Special mention to Prakash Joshi (kalyani restaurant) who has been serving with a smile. Chandan from housekeeping who made the room clean for making us feel better as there was milk spillage by us but he did not hesitate to clean it 4 times for us to feel better with no smell.

Shailesh,Vismita County need to have a relook at the pricing.,The property is extremely pricey with respect to the rooms and amenities. Especially during off season time it should have been at half of what we paid. Breakfast and food in the restaurant is good. Owner should add more amenities to make it deserve the money being charged. The staff is quite courteous.,1

saif a,Weekend trip to a coffee estate near Bangalore,"There's no provision of 3.5 ratings, else 3.5 is the perfect fit. Rooms : 4.5 star - I had a independent villa with a private pool. Everything about the room was perfect, but the privacy of the pool. The way to the pool is open to the glare of adjacent room balconies. Service: 5 star: Everyone among the staff pool was courteous and were always at service Food: 3 star: The breakfast spread (complimentary) was below par. After spending 20k+ for a night, spread should be something to be watched out for. I expected better. Only a la carta was available during lunch and dinner, prices were reasonable. Amenities 3.5 star: A 21 acre property in which more than 15 acres can't be accessed. They haven't properly quitilized the space. Such a beautiful property but so much little to do.",1

Our stay was pleasant and staff service was excellent (Chandan and Nalini from house keeping). Food was tasty and staff at canteen is very cooperative (Raghu). overall environment was top notch except dispute handling about our booking where we made booking through Agoda for 4 adult + one child but reception argued that we have to pay for extra bed for child. even though we said, we don't need an extra bed. at the end we agreed to pay for that extra bed for kid. Nevertheless, I take that as their policy and I respect it but they could have been more flexible in handling such issue as I stayed in Hyatt Hampi for 4 nights before arriving at vismita County which was booked under same booking ID with Agoda were Hyatt",1

A couple of things to fine tune further: 1. We felt we could've had an event or two..say a MC conducting games/events to socialize better in the evenings (even if only 30 minutes) or a plantation tour within campus. 2. A sign board or two for the resort up-ahead could've helped, over and above the google map (we drove from HASSAN/BELUR side) 3. The medical kit at resort needs to be stocked-up and audited.

We booked directly through their website since at the time of booking, I could not find any price difference across TripAdvisor, Booking.com, MakeMyTrip and the website.  Will go with cons first since it is a short list. Cons: - While their website said Rs.12,000 per night for a Cottage superior with balcony and breakfast, we had to pay Rs.34,500 per night since our 10 year old daughter was accompanying us. Cost of almost Rs.5000 per night for a child seemed very steep. - For the price charged, I found the room and bathroom to be small. Although, to add, they were very clean and well appointed.

The security guard treats you like trespassers.. Then you reach the reception.. forget a warm welcome or a welcome drink you don't even get a glass of water at the reception. The staff have been trained to spew out rules rules and more rules..NO is their standard answer for anything and everything. It feels like a Military Camp with so many rules that you get irritated at every juncture..  5 star rates but Bus-stand lodge level hospitality.

To be honest, the whole resort is beautiful. Infact, both the restaurants too served some really good food.   The only thing that disappointed us was the staff at the reception. Inspite having been informed thrice about our early check-out they refused to serve the breakfast, let alone early, not even at their stipulated time at 8. When confronted, the person at the reception says the breakfast is ready which was nothing but plain lies.   Also, if you are checking out early be prepared to carry your own luggage from your room to the parking lot since the buggies only operate after 8. Imagine!! Ughhh!  The checkout experience in short was horrendous. It ruined our pleasent",1

Jazz Bangalore,A hidden gem,"Vismita County is an amazing place in Chikmagalur. We were a little skeptical because of the way the booking was handled (all on phone and whatsapp, with a confirmation on whatsapp and no mail) but boy was the place good. The resort is relatively small with a set of rooms within a lush coffee plantation. The greenery is breathtakingly beautiful with tall trees in the backdrop. It has two places to eat, Kurinji the main restaurant where breakfast is also served and Kalyani bar.The food in Kurinji is regular indian and continental fare and tastes good. The Kalyani bar can certainly do with better food..Whatever we ordered was below par. The resort has very clean and well maintained rooms with amazing staff.

To the north is Baba Budangiri, a mountain range in the Western Ghats, with 3 large caves said to be holy. Trails through forests and grasslands lead up to Mullayanagiri Peak. Reaching this place is easy but where to stay ?? I did lot of Google research and finally found decent reviews about this property/ Resort.

Right from check in done by Sushmitha to the room to the view to the food everything is nice.  Staff is very helpful and courteous ; the whole front desk team led by aishwarya is very helpful.  I must mention that food is better than Taj or serai.

The resort has some great food particularly for lunch and dinner. The menu is limited but, every item we ordered was delicious and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The phulkas were so soft and good to eat, the curries were delicious.  Breakfast is a buffet and is alright. Breakfast could be improved. Chutney, Sambar was good on some days and wasn't fresh on others. Parathas weren't stuffed",1

tejalinga,Nice but lil expensive for what they offer,"I visited Vismita county only coz my friend was on design team of the resort. It's located some 20kms away from Chickmagalur but not in hilly place. The property is small but nice. The staff was courteous and kind, especially Vineet and madam at reception desk. The rooms are huge and well kept but the  rooms are very close to each other in the building and don't give a sense of privacy, also we could clearly see the small villas. We loved the food served to us but there's limited menu. The resort could do with more activities for adults. These are not complaints but just suggestions. The only real   downside I felt is the  pricing is on expensive side for what they have to offer. We group of 5 had to spend 30k for one day stay including lunch. Which is very expensive. Overall I",1

I guess 21 rooms in all, but well maintained and most of them are pratically new. The place is almost 20 acres and the feel is that you are staying in an estate and can just enjoy the nature anytime during the day or even at night. The entire place can be explored by foot, cycles and even they have a buggy to take you up & down from the room to the reception, restaurant etc.  We had all our meals at the hotel, whatever was recomended by the staff at the restaurant was really good and we all enjoyed it.

Avishek Beuria,Excellent experience,We went to Vismita County on 3rd week of October and stayed there for 2 nights. The resort is built inside a coffee estate with brilliant landscaping. It has been maintained nicely and the staff is also courteous. Food was tasty but you may not get lot of options (no complains here as u will get all standard items in veg and non veg). The stay was pleasant and relaxing. They do not have a kids play area which they can think to include in future. Overall a highly recommended resort to spend your holidays,1

chandan p,Short Vacation with friends,"Location - great, excellent views, sprawling area, surrounded by plantation, away from main road. Nice walking trails, a lake behind.   Facilities - bicycles, TT, Snooker to keep you occupied. Swimming pool, though closed when we had visited. The restaurant has a good outdoor seating place to enjoy nature. The rooms were big, well furnished, though some of the fittings were not working smooth, like in our case the door didnt close smoothly  Service - good service, but the people are not trained in hospitality. Soemthing which we can easily figure out if you compare with proper hospitality chains like Taj. For example, if you ask for room service, the person would enter the room with shoes on leaving behind shoe marks on floor.  Wifi was patchy.  Food - thats the worst part. Food",1

neha2016,Comfortable stay but we need to be careful,"We stayed with Vistara during 2nd oct long weekend. The stay I would say was comfortable but the price was much higher compared similar resorts we stay in Ooty and Kodaikanal. The place was regularly sanitized and people had masks all day which was good during Covid-19. The breakfast menu and food menu available at rooms had limited options but the quality and taste was good. We ordered an egg sandwich which turned out to salty so they gave a complimentary sandwich   The things which really upset me was  1. The surrounding area of hotel mostly the restaurant, parking and lobby area was not well maintained.. the leaves were dry falling off everywhere and pond was very dirty. The trees and plant were not pruned and it was turning out to be a jungle . 2. The room food menu does not",1

Not much on the menu so we decided to go for whatever special was cooked for the day and it worth every penny. They santize your room daily, take care of food hygiene. Highly recommend.

The hotel cut off the power at night for the AC, Kettle and Jacuzzi. We didn't realize this and wasted 1 hr struggling at night finding the AC switch and could not sleep. When we complained early in the morning, immediately the power was restored. Also the TV d2h was not recharged, they only did it once we raised a complaint. It was late in the evening and we had to call the concierge to fix it, he came in without wearing a mask (this is covid 19 time). Also with respect to a luxury resort, the toiletries provided were pretty basic - the shampoo and shower gel were not at all good but we hadn't carried our own so we had to use them.

PriyankaMJ,"Nice property, bad rooms!","It's a huge property which has everything an outdoor adventure enthusiast may want, nature trails, wilderness, birds, lake, sunset point and silence...  My issue with Kalgreen is the quality of their rooms, be it their old villa or the row house rooms, they are old and badly maintained. Most need repair work and have plenty of insects inside. We could find spiders on the bed, curtains, bathrooms and towels. I really wish they'd focus on upping their stay quality.  Their food is simple and home cooked, so don't expect resort varieties or taste. We loved the open jeep that was used to ferry us around with our dogs, to the lake and sunset point. Both were beautiful places and worth the time we spent. We did a 3 hour hike within the property and it was a great experience.  Overall,",10

You can all meet up by the restaurant which walkable distance from then rooms. From resturant, i remember the food offered there..such homely delicous food ,truely makes you fall in love with the malnad style of cuisine.

The owners took such good care of us especially Anita who was so friendly and a warm host . Loved everything about the place especially the morning trek in the resort seeing some good pepper tress ,betelnut trees and other plantations in their 500 acre property was worth a visit..the staff served good sumptuous food with a smile on their face and what more can we ask for :) I would recommend the resort to family, group of friends and bikers to drop in here and have a comfortable safe stay .

Food & Rooms: The food served is real good and fresh. Especially if you order some starters for the bonfire. The rooms provided are homespun complementing with nature around and very neat. Moreover, you will hardly stay in the room, as there is so much to do.  Activities/Adventure: The real experience comes when you make the trek. The coffee plantation, fruit trees, crops,",10

The place is spanned by a generous spread of coffee estates, a lake , swimming pool. The best part of the lake is one can boat at his or her own leisure. The lake is a treat to watch many variety of birds. The rooms sport a typical ancient look but with excellent upkeep. Last but not the least, the staff members are extremely helpful and ensure each little thing is taken care off. Cuisine is a treat to your taste buds.   Overall a place to keep visiting again and again",10
Manasa Sridhar,The best place.,"I've visited and stayed at the Kalgreen Valley Resort a couple of times and every time i travel towards Chikkamagaluru, this is the only place that pops up in my mind. The estate is so beautiful with never ending activities (trekking, fruit plucking, fishing, swimming, jeep rides are some of my favorites). The food that they provide, i still think of it often, it is so good, fresh and you'll just want to fill your stomachs. The rooms are very rustic and gives you a feel of a nature-resort  which is very true to it's origin. I would recommend this place to anyone and TRUST ME, you'll have the best time! :D",10

She even called on the morning of 8th October when we were on our way. We had set Kalgreen Valley resort in Google map from Bangalore itself. As directed by Mrs. Bernie, we gave her a call once we reached a small town called Jayapura which is 21 kms from the resort (if you follow usual google route).

Narendar N,A serene stay !!!!!,We were 2 couples and with some research zeroed in on Kalgreen valley resort.. Reasons for choosing.. Well w.r.t price all resorts were pretty much similarly priced in Chikkamagalur i.e per person per night basis.. Tripadvisor Reviews and the activities in the resort made us choose this one.. One more reason was accessibility when commuting by bus.. We Took a train to shivamogga and then a 2 hr bus journey to chikmagalur bus stop.. From there we took an auto who charged us around 220 Rs to drop us to the resort.. Overall was easy to reach the destination.. The resort is around 10-12 Kms from the bus stop.   I personally categorise my trips as relax at the resort or go around nearby places.. This resort is great for relax at the resort sort of vacation coz I love spending time,10
Shruti B,"Peaceful, close to nature stay","Kalgreen valley resort is a getaway from stressful city life. Many people complained about how inaccessible the resort is or the facilities it provided but hey man, if you want to be close to nature, you shouldn't look into these matters.  From koppa it's a 25-minute auto drive, [he charged us only 250rs/-, that's pretty decent rate compared to what the resort had offered (auto-rs350/-)]. We were welcomed and immediately taken to our rooms (we booked the row houses). When it came to the rooms, they were pretty decent, basic and clean. Yes, you might come across insects, bugs, leeches etc etc.. that's because you are in a jungle (one tip- wear shoes).  The food was tasty, homely and always served warm (don't expect for 4-5 star meals). Chicken is served as the only non-veg dish",10

Drawbacks: No intercom facility, but I didn't feel the need. No WIFI. Signal was not good with some service providers like Vodafone etc.   The overall experience was excellent.

Right from welcome to good bye it was a very professional service from the team and I should say the best person to manage was in charge of the property.   It will be a complete escape from day to day life and staying there for at least two days will definitely make you really fresh.  When I complemented the manager on excellent and professional service it was surprising to hear from him that in hospitality business that is basic and for his own benefit. Common even in some of the MNC companies at gross root level this factor is dwindling. Food was awesome and fresh and it was on dot time.

I had heard from friends that the final mud road track leading to the resort was a bit damaged at certain spots. But I was in for a pleasant surprise when I drove down on a smooth tarred road track at jet speed.  We had a great time devouring food prepared in the south Canara coastal and Malnand cuisine style.

The following early morning we could hear the bleating of a black buck deer at a distance from our room in the resort. Probably, the deer had either sighted or sensed the presence of the Bengal tiger in the close vicinity.

Sathya V,Home away from home!,"We visited Kalgreen Valley last week. We had made the choice to go to Kalgreen based on our Agency's recommendation (we were considering Eagle Eye Resort). It was a fabulous decision! Kalgreen Valley Resort, managed well by caretaker Hameed and his dedicated staff (we remember Manjunath particularly) create and maintain a relaxed atmosphere that puts everyone at ease. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and plenty of hot water. Food at Kalgreen is a delight especially for vegetarians. Even the guests whom we met there were kind, and well mannered. The goodwill was infectious.   Getting to Kalgreen is straight forward, with new roads (paved completely).  The rooms have no TV, but you will never miss it. Our room also had no cellular access and that was a blessing too! Use",10

Dinesh R,Very nice location with amenities but beware of the route,"First of all, this place is not in Chikamagalur. Its 90 kms from Chikamagalur in a town called Koppa.  About the resort -  The resort has a combination of individual cottages and row-houses. Row houses have 5 rooms (cottage style) next to each other but gives you good privacy once you are in. No fans or A/C in the rooms (not required as well as the weather is cool enough). We went around monsoon time, as that's the time to visit such places; the only flip side being, you cannot leave the door of the rooms open after dark even for a minute else it will be invaded by flying insects (they are absolutely harmless :) ). The ambiance inside the rooms resemble a hut with medium height door frames ; even a 5 ft person has to bend while passing through them. But thats the theme the",10

Hari_Palakat,Awesome Experience !!!,"As a couple we had an awesome experience hanging out with nature. Two days weekend trip started from Benguluru to Koppa. From Koppa bus stand resort authorities arranged a cab to trap 15km up hill to reach row houses. Good experience with Boating,Bamboo view,Sunset point etc. Awesome food prepared by the cook and in-charge (Umesh). If you are planning to visit better visit in group to enjoy the maximum. Very good climate and all facilities were provided by the resort authorities. Thanks to tripadvisor travellers for honest review.  Must try once :)",10

We reached the resort at 9.30 and received with a lemon juice. The staff in the resort were very helpful and they arranged for a jeep drive to boating,bamboo walk,plantation visit and sunset point. The rooms and toilets were clean and well kept. The resort is picturesque and there is a nice swimming pool also.Amidst nature you can keep yourself busy for 2 days. Only drawback we faced was the  simple lunch.Evening they made it up with something nice.Overall it is a good resort and with friendly staff.",10
Hethin,My experience about Kalgreen Valley Resort,"The place at which the resort is build is just amazing, beautiful scenic view, birds chirping, you can even spot a Peacock in your door step if you are lucky to wake up at early 5am. But to reach the resort you have to make a circus, call your mechanic and have the orders placed - you have to be ready to change your car's shock absorbers as soon you head back to City. Ensure you have a valid vehicle insurance to get the insurance covered for the repair/new.  The rooms are well build in ethnic style, we were welcomed very warmly, but no warm water to bath or even a glass of water served or kept in the room. If you fall thirst in the mid of sleep, you are gone. Better carry a bottle of water along. Mineral water bottles can be sourced only at 50kms before the resort.   Amazing",10

(Note: roads are so slippers you cannot travel in normal vehicle, you need 4 wheel driving in front of your vehicle to get in to the safer path, some how they had arranged 4wheel vehicle to follow that helped us to follow the path in safer way) Finally we held up paying extra to driver to drive is such roads, and he told again he will come to such places. > After reaching there rooms are good!  >But no welcome drink or",10

Trekking along the coffee estate and the boat ride on the lake was nice.. Other ratings below...  Rooms : 6/10. ( Quality of the mattress and Cots not that great.. Manageable. Do not provide water bottle inside the room while check inn ) Clean Toilets  Food : 4/10 .. Very  Very bad..  Ned to improvise a lot. The quality of the food is bad and the varieties are less...

onamigration,The best jeep ride ever in the rain!!!,"The Kalgreen Resort in some 100 kms away from the Chikamangalaur City. So,all the tourist and sight seeing places are far away.  Anyways 1st advice, DON‚ÄôT FOLLOW THE GPS, leads you to a route where you 2 wheel drive car can get stuck. Call up the resort in advance and take down the directions. The last 4 kms stretch of road to the resort,umm‚Ä¶ let me just out it that way‚Ä¶don‚Äôt drive it by yourself, no matter how experienced driver you are. There are 2 reasons: 1st- It is dangerous and so leave it to the resort driver‚Äôs, 2nd- If you‚Äôre driving you would miss the awesome view of the hills.

Travelfreak02,Amazing resort amidst nature...,"Kalgreen resort is an amazing place to unwind from the monotonous city life. The drive to the resort was a bit adventurous with the south west monsoon and muddy road. Vehicles with 4wd can be driven to the resort during monsoon else the resort has a parking place 4kms away. From here guests are taken in a jeep. Trekking, swimming, boating, tea plantation visit, sunset view point, big bamboo visit, bird watching are the activities available there. The resort charges includes breakfast, lunch, evening tea and dinner. The staffs were very kind and helpful. Thanks for making our stay memorable.",10
MrMrsRao,Short Stay,"This resort is almost 1.5 hrs from Chikmagalur and amidst a mountain valley. We (2 adults 2 kids) finally reached the resort after a very long drive from Bangalore. The last 10-15 km of road to the resort are mud roads and will be in horrible condition if it rains. Not a soul will be found on the way if the vehicle gets stuck in the mud road !!!  We were allotted room immediately. The rooms are very basic in the row house with just a bed and a fan. At night, you can find all types of insect species around the rooms. Families with kids need to be very cautious.   Hospitality of the staff is very good. Food was good too.  The resort has a good swimming pool. There are no guards in the swimming pool and hence its our own responsibility. There are also no changing rooms and hence",10
VANDANA K,Awesome location to spend quiet time,This was our first trip to coffee estates in Chikmagalur and was a memorable one. Before heading to Kalgreen we spent a night at Belur. So our drive to the estate was not too long. Because of heavy rain the last 4KM stretch was not motorble. Resort management made arrangements to park our car in another estate and transferred us to the resort in a jeep.  The resort is located just in the middle of a huge (400 acres) of coffee plantation and is really beautiful. It's calm and quiet with chirping birds and peacocks. Rooms are good and worth the cost. Rooms were cooler and did not require fan. We got a two room row house with 5 beds. The setting of swimming pool was awesome.   Staff were friendly and always willing to him. Food was tasty and we tasted some Malnad delicacies.  Tea,10
VishnuBoseSreekovil,On your own!!!!,"We had been to this property in 2011. This was our first trip to Chikmagalur, but this property was nother 100Km far. We were four adults and two kids and the travel was exhausting. The last stretch of road within the property was difficult for our car as it was meant for the 4WD. There were few row houses and a bungalow which was secluded and had 3 bedrooms; we had to climb a bit more to reach the bungalow. I guess it was called the 'Dore Mane'. Once we reached the bungalow it was refreshing. This was our first experience inside an estate almost looking wild. The food was superb... yummy ....the home made butter was something you feel like going back for. There was a cook/caretaker with us in the bungalow. We never felt any disturbance from others, since the bungalow was",10

Luke,Loved it!,"My first time at Chikmaglur and it was possibly the best the place had to offer. A stay at Kalgreen and we were 100% satisfied with what they had to offer us. It took us a while to figure out the place but I guess it was worth it .  Extremely considerate and friendly hosts, always willing to help with enthusiasm and a smile. Clean rooms and services. the cottages and row houses are cleaned on a daily basis and well maintained. The food was fresh , delicious and homely.  the weather was slightly uncomfortable, and we wish to visit Kalgreen during the monsoon season , to enjoy our stay to the fullest. The best part of the resort was the huge pool. we loved sitting, surrounded by greens and large canopies . Clear blue water, pure bliss! The bar by the pool was closed , it would",10

I liked the dining hall the most.And how can i miss the sunset point, it was a different story that it was drizzling all day n couldnt see the sun, but the whole area was filled with mist, cool breeze... on the whole a very memorable trip...Thank you Kal Green Valley!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",10
RichieJohnPais,Excellent Monsoon Hideout,"I have visited Kalgreen Valley for the past four years during monsoon. Well, I visit the place during summer and winter also as it is one of my favourite places. But during monsoon I do  feel this is the ultimate place in Karnataka. The rainfall in Koppa area during monsoon is around 125 inches. This valley  resort is surrounded by Mountains from all the sides. The mountains are not stingy to send rains down the valley. The experience is something you could only get in Agumbe ghats years back. But while you get the same experience here, you also get the great hospitality in a spectacular ambiance. We stayed in the bungalow this time while we had already stayed in the row houses before. On request even authentic local food is provided. The sunset point here is the best. Added",10

It was one of the most relaxing weekends that we have had in months. We were given a warm welcome by the staff who were very helpful and attentive. The food was absolutely fantastic, and the place was breathtaking! The lake, sunset point and tea gardens were the highlight of our trip.

jjp10773,Decent place,"The first take is that it is a plantation house, which is not far from truth. We had been there during a week day so probably lucky to escape the weekend crowd. The owners are very amicable and nice. The staff, even though didn't know any other language apart from Kannada, are also very helpful and cheerfull. My son enjoyed the swimming pool which is an added advantage. The pool though needs some bit of upkeep it is not dirty just had a lot of insects. Do not expect super luxury room, this is a budge place, it has just about the basic amenities. The rooms also need a bit of cleaning but certainly liveable. We were also lucky to spot some wild peacocks early in the morning which was also great. Places to look around like the sunset point and the plantation visits are great. The",10

The row houses were rustic and clean with attached bathrooms!! The food was awesome and everyone in our group liked it from breakfast to dinner. There was variety and good value for money.   The staff  were courteous and hospitable and awake till late night. The camp fire in the cold night breeze was balmy. Places to visit around Kalgreen Valley include the Sunset point atop a hill. The tea estate there is beautiful and reminds you of the kinds you see in movies. You can also go boating on a lake nearby. The amazing variety of birds in",10

Kalgreen resort is full of greenery and peace, you can get yourself lost with the nature. he resort has a private lake with boating which is amazing. we took the vegetarian food at the resort which was very delicious, we felt like as if we are having home food. The hospitality  is really good through out the our stay even when we were leaving back to Bangalore the cab driver was very helpful he was with us till we board the bus. The best part which i like is there is no network connectivity , so we were free for 2 full days without any mobile disturbance.

KarthikMunichoodappa,sad but true,"I feel sad to write this negative review about this place, but if I don't it would be a disservice to others who go their un prepared. Our group comprised of 7 families that included 14 adults and 9 children. Coming to the specifics of the place , As such the place is exotic, with a beautiful lake,virgin nature all of God's making, but don't expect 5 star facilities, accommodation is good by standards of home stay,  bathrooms are ok with erratic hot water supply.  Food is good but the menu is limited.  The high points of our stay was the trek, led by a  local coffee estate labourer by name annappa, he deserves to be praised, all he had was a machet and torn rubber chappals but trekked one of the difficult and dense terrains.  A new pool that was just then opened is awesome. The",10
Bhingri,Tranquility and Peace...,"The first thing that comes to my mind when I think about Kalgreen is peace. It is a sprawling property with more such properties skirting it, so there are lush green hills, scenic ponds, rustic tracks all around you, as far as you see. The property is well maintained. The staff is completely non-intrusive, but there to help you whenever you need. The meals were like home-cooked food served with good hospitality. We stayed in the Villa which is at quite some distance from the main establishment (the row houses, canteen etc). But that added to the solitude and peace, which was the main agenda for us. Nothing much in terms of activity, there is boating, jungle walks (well this is an coffee estate, so the jungle is not real jungle), Sunset point, tea garden... nothing spectacular as",10

The resort has a huge forest area and there is plenty of scope for trekking and forest walking,  and mountaineering as well.  If you are nature lover, there is no better place to visit than this.  There is plenty of scope for bird watchers as well.  The resort has a well maintained lake and one can swim and/or make use of the pedal boat.  You can even do the rod fishing,  and you will not be disappointed.  The resort is fairly new,  and there were a few teething problems I believe, especially when it comes to food",10

Gave  chapathis for lunch and dinner... (3 sessions) .. Breakfast had lemon rice and so called idlis wrapped in leaves... Idlis had flies in it... The music system was not clear.. Even the best of songs were like duds.. When we mentioned  these short coming .. The staff including the manager turned hostile..the manager/owner was drunk and he threatened to beat us..

nagendra p,pleasant stay,"The resort is clean and nice. Location is beautiful. Food is excellent. The resort staff are very good as well. The resort has a private lake close by which is just amazing. They even have a boat ride.  There is a sunset point around as well. Its a good place to go around for a trek. Overall the place is good for a family outing for a couple of days. They have a jeep and will be more than happy to ferry you around. Now for the cons, this resort is located around 2.5 hr drive from chikmaglur city. And from the main road you need to take a diversion which takes a 10 km drive on a non-existing road! . You might feel a bit lost in this last stretch. This place is pretty close to shringeri, hornadu, agumbe and makes it a ideal place to stay if you are planning to these temples over",10

Here they had 3 bed rooms, of which 1 bed room could accommodate 3 adults easily, the other 2 rooms could fit in 2 adults per room easily. It has got a kitchen and 2 support to help you all through the day. Even there is a very cozy drawing cum dining room where you can sit and have a good get together.

Our team, all of us are professionals and travel a lot across the country / globe hence changing the date was bit challenging.  However, somehow they could organize one more homestay nearby,  nice one, comfortable for families, not commercialized hence the care was nice but it was not very comfortable for 13 (adult) of us.   We often go out for get-together, hence Home stay concept is not new for us. Homestay is Good business for estate",11

TravelnExploren,Excellent stay at good earth ..,"We stayed at good earth with family , loved the place it was quite and peaceful, it was one of a kind of experience. The hospitality extended at the homestay was good and the food was great. Had a great stay and would definitely like to visit this place again and would recommend to others too..",11
Sanjay,"Not Worth, Very Bad Hospitality !!","After reading so many positive reviews on this site , without a second thought i booked this homestay, the bungalow one. I was shocked when i visited there with my family couple of days back, the first impression from outside was very great , once when we entered the accommodation we were shocked to see that the place was not cleaned and beds were not ready. Anyway, upon request they started getting Bed sheets & pillow covers which were very unclean with stains and torn covers probably by cockroaches, thank god i was carrying the bed sheets. The interiors like the furnitures and other things were very old not maintained properly.   I was reading reviews about good hospitality, but absolutely the caretaker especially lady was very moody, for everything we needed to remind her,",11
Pradeep K,"Excellent Location, Mouth watering food","It is located in the midst of the coffee plantations with very good connectivity. We were served some mouth watering dishes, one of the best I have ever had. The host is an excellent person and takes care of every need of yours. Mullainagiri is located about 30 kms from here and well connected by road. We were a family of 12 and stayed in the bunglow. Overall, a good experience and I highly recommend this place.",11

Food was really good, simple and best.  They have dormitory, which is a room having some 6 beds and a bathroom. They also have a bungalow. Bungalow and dormitory were clean and well maintained. There are swings and small playing area for kids.   The homestay is surrounded by coffee plantations. Morning its a wonderful sight with fog surrounding you and mountains far away.

However, if you need anything specific, please inform in advance. They also have a bonfire in the evening and it is a pleasant experience just sitting around it for a while. There are no other facilities to write about like games, sports etc but this place is just a weekend getaway and very reasonably priced as well.

Worst part , septic tank smell started coming in room after 10, which forced me to immediately vacate room next day.",11
Praveen B,Good service and excellent location,"Just returned to Bangalore after a reenergised and rejuvenating weekend monsoon getaway from Chikamagalur with friends. We were welcomed by rain, we were treated with lots of rain and we returned back in rain. Chikamagalur is best to be visited during winter or during pre-monsoon period. You will feel the serenity with nature at Chikamagalur. We braved the rain and explored most prominent places mullayanagiri, kemmanagundi, Kalahatti falls, Belur temple, yagachi dam, yagachi water sport, Shooting spot 2 km away from the Homestay. We enjoyed visiting every place. The harsh cold wind at mullayangiri was an experience. I recommend to carry warm jackets and rain coat to this peak on a rainy day. The road to the peak is narrow and bad. It's better to hire a jeep to this place. Road",11

The place is extremely clean and well kept. Since 9 of us had gone, we had booked the dorm. It is basic but well maintained and clean. There is a bungalow with 3 more rooms. The view from the dorm is SPECTACULAR. Nights are gorgeous too. Luckily for us we were there during a full moon.  Food was awesome too. Good, homely freshly cooked food.

There are 2 big bedrooms & 1 dormitory. The bathroom is very clean & hot water was available round the clock.Food is awesome & plenty. Hospitality is too good, the best part which we liked the most was there was a lady who is available all the time & also before dinner she will change the bed sheet, tuck in the blanket & make the bed  which I am sure we do not find in any 5star hotel also. The ambiance was awesome. The homestay is located in the heart of nature where you van have a total hassle free time, no network works except BSNL hence if one wants a break from our daily routine, I will suggest this is the best place to send a day.",11
Saswati Das,Silent Valley Resort - Chikmagalur - An ultimate combination of comfort and the best of hospitality.,"We chose this place looking at the wide range of reviews, and to be honest we were sceptical in the beginning. However, when  we reached, the very first reaction was 'wow'. The staff are extremely courteous, the resort is beautifully maintained, the food served is delicious and the scenic beauty around is to die for. One can actually see the clouds floating from this resort. I infact wanted to extend my stay but my leaves were over and i had to come back.  If you are planning to visit , ensure you attend the campfire. It's such a beautiful set up. The cherry on the cake was it was drizzling while we were there , so the heat of the campfire was extremely cozy. Special mention to Mr. Dayanand and Mr.Umesh!

The staff was very kind to take care of us, special thanks to Mr. Dayanand for accommodating in a beautiful villa, Mr. Sanket for guiding us through the city tour, Mr. Naveen for offering us wonderful dishes throughout, and all the Housekeeping staff and the Manger who had taken utmost care of us.

Room 210 and 211,CHEAT- Fake pictures and services mentioned on the website,"The hotel is worst in condition. Actual reality is complete opposite.  Room pictures does not resemble to what is placed on trip advisor and make my trip or facebook or the resort website.

The pool facility was also available which children enjoyed a lot. The rooms were decent and clean. All in all it was a good package.

TravelEnthu_8,Leaves a lot to be improved,"I agree with some of the fellow reviewers here - there were several things which need improvement:  Infrastructure was sub-standard - - Only water in a jug. No electric kettle in the room either. This is basic. - No table/bench in the room to keep luggage on. You have to leave the luggage on the floor. - No intercom/phone in the rooms. So if you need anything from the front desk, God help you. Especially given that outside slim JIO connectivity, no other provider network is available.   The only flip side was that the service was good. Staff are excellent, attentive, extremely courteous and helpful. So even in the absence of phone, we found someone always at hand with whom we could communicate and send requests.   Food quality/taste were also good.  TV had some channels but most",12

Not value for money","First, about the service. Dayanand, resort manager, and his team, are excellent, attentive, extremely courteous and helpful. This is the only positive about the stay.  Second, about the infrastructure. Sub-standard, not value for money for 7K per night. Let me list these out: - no branded water, only water in a jug. How old, how pure is uncertain; - no table in the room to keep luggage on. You have to keep luggage on the floor and bend to the floor or sit on the floor, to access your suitcase; - no central hot water system, but individual geysers in each room. Shower does not work. So you fill a bucket of hot water and bathe and wait wet and cold for the geyser to make the water hot again, since geyser can fill one bucket of hot water only at a time before running out of hot",12

Prashanth,Nice Place for peaceful vacation,"We went with a doubt in after reading few of the bad reviews, thoughts changed once we reached the place. We reached late in the afternoon around 3.30pm and we were welcomed with happy faces of the managed Dayanad. Since we drove non stop from Bangalore didn't get a chance to stop for lunch however Dayanand ensured that we had a hot lunch before even we could check in.   We got a upgrade from cottage to villa rooms that's another surprise.  Rooms were neat and tidy with 24*7 hot water facility which is a must considering the weather.   Food was served hot and tasted good as well.   None of our mobiles worked as there was no network coverage available at the facility.

The resort is in a valley in the Western Ghats, 10 minute drive from Kalasa, 10 more to Horanadu. Cottages separate by a minute's walk from each other The cottages are simple - not too basic, not too lavish, but very homely in each aspect of the furnishing and the linen.  The best part of the resort is the lipsmacking food. Authentic Malnad cuisine dished out with a perfect blend of spices, reminds me of my grandmother's cooking in days gone by.   Mr Dayanand and his team took great care both times we were there. Kudos!  PS - be sure to have a vehicle handy when visiting the resort if you plan any visits around the place",12

After the booking, their entire attitude changes and they don't really care what happens to you at the actual resort.

We missed the waterfall but other surrounding areas like hanging bridge, amba theertha river, Mydhady, tea estate were easily accesible and safe place for kids as well. For old people it might be little difficult but we took the car upto the cottage to drop my mother in law.

Firstly it had unfinished narrow dingy entrance.Room for 4 was big enough but lacked storage for luggage, bathroom is also ok and managable (2/5). Buffet dinner was ready only by 9.20 pm and my children were hungry. Buffet spread was not impressive (2/5). Now for the best part : Cottage room had 4 small cots, one cot was broken in the middle and not usable, the pillows and sheets were looking dirty with old stains and very flimsy blankets which kept us cold in the night.There was no intercom facility to call for the room service either. Early morning we checked out at 7.am without even tea or coffee.",12

Towels given were all wet got replaced when I raised complaint, fittings were broken.

The finger licking unlimited buffet breakfast, lunch & dinner is simply superb with variety of south & North Indian home made flavored food. You get anything else of your choice on request for a very reasonable price. The atmosphere and rooms are exceptionally different from the stays in city with touch of natural beauty.

If you are few people, there is barely anything you can do here. Although the management was cleaning the swimming pool rigoursly in front of us, the water in the swimming pool looked muddy or green.

It was one of those long weekends when every place (including this) was completely booked and we got a last minute reservation here. We booked into a cottage. The place is very serene and relaxing. However, the cottages need to be better maintained. The furniture is in a very run down state. The cottage was very spacious but there was no cupboard or table inside the room and only a mirror in the bathroom. These are basic necessities and need to be taken care of.  Despite these short falls, we had a good time mainly because of the extremely friendly staff, the swimming pool (small but well-maintained) and the ample space all around. The food was also good.",12

Good place to relax and spend some time",12
Iqbal K,"Nice for a base camp, but needs better cell coverage","The resort is nice and down to earth place. The cottages/rooms are good and the staff cooperating. The couple of things to the management there are these - 1) The place needs better cleaning; 2 ) get the dinning area some side walls. In winter and the monsoons it gets pretty cold and windy and finally 3) turn that music down during meal time. Lots of trekking and relaxing (massages, or just lazing around!). Talk to the front desk to know more about the activities and what tours or treks are available. While the monsoon months will be wet, it is also the best time to view Kudaremukha and surrounding areas. Be careful of the leeches though!",12
Vaisakh S,Good Place to relax away from everyday life..,"The place is away from city and noise and cell coverage(which some might find as a downside.) They have wifi at the restaurant though. The staff were very friendly and helpful and gave tips on the nearby places to visit and arranged for commute as well. The food was also very good, with multiple options for veg as well as non-veg.",12
Samuel R,Overall a excellent place to relax with friends and family,My family had been there last month .we were 9 of us .we got a good price compared to the home stays around .we booked the resort mainly because of the swimming pool .A we were greeted well and our rooms were well maintained.the food had decent options and we were vegetarians .there is lot of greenary around and places to visit.we were also given a guide as we new to the place .overall a very happy experience.will definitely visit again if I get a good discount :p,12
Natasha P,Well maintained resort. ....my thumbs up,We had been to silent valley resort in this month .overall it is a great place with a nice homely feel to it.we have been to a lot of places and i have to say the pool is mainted well being a hill station.food and the cottages were good and seems to have been recently renovated. Would recommend it .,12
Shreyeshvi R,Highly not recommended,"Firstly, the rooms aren't that good.. be it cottages, villas or tree house..secondly, the staff and the hospitality sucks big time. The way they speak on phone is waaay different to what they are in person. They don't even guide u well about the sightseeing places nearby.. N there's no network to use Google maps either. No value for money at all. They get 2 stars from me for the food.. which wasn't great but manageable.. the Wi-Fi which is available at least in the restaurant area and the pool.. which was maintained well. If u ask me.. if say skip this place.",12
Rayan H,A place worth experiencing!,Had been there a few weeks back. The place was beautiful and had a chilled out atmosphere. Our villa was really nice..the service was awesome! The owners come and ask about our experience! its a place we would like to go again!,12
Vishant D,Wonderfull place to visit and have a conference,Our company had planned for a vacation cum conference .We chose silent valley as they were the only once who could accommodate 100 of us and they had a conference hall.We had requested for a few extra speakers n dj .They were very helpful and helped us in conducting a great conference .The food is excellent and there is a lot of variety .What we enjoyed a lot was the jeep ride which was organized for us .There some rally remarkable places to visit. A must visit for people who are tired of coorg .A nice change,12
Reyon L,Excellent gateway from the busy life and traffic,"Had been there with my family. The drive was almost 6.5hours from bangalore with lot of lovely places to Choos from.we had a booking done in advance and got a good discount. In fact the response of the booking team was really quick. We stayed in the ethnic cottages, they reminded me of childhood. Very well maintained property with lots of activities in and around the resort. Food n hospitality is one thing that really makes this place stand out. Nice ambiance n family loved the swimming pool and peace of nature",12
Merlyn R,Wonderful place . . .Surely recommended and Will visit again,"Our family reunion of all cousins around 30 plus members we had gone to Kalasa and Kudremukh area. We had wonderful stay at Silent Valley Resort around 4kms away from Kalasa. On first day we visited our cousins estate in Jaypora, He had lush green plantation and gifted us all high quality pepper. Second day we visited nearby places like Amba Theertha River, Hanging Bridge, Mydhady and Ballal Kings Fort as per itenarary given by resort manager Nishal. Evening the kids enjoyed in swimming pool, playing badminton. Night we had booked for exclusive campfire and unlimited starters. The chefs had prepared good quantity of mouth watering fish manchurian, Chicken tikka and Veg kebab. We played Antakshari and danced and ended it with wide spread buffet.

Sanjay P,Stay away!,"The rooms - pathetic maintenance. Dirty toilet with rusted fixtures, rock hard bed, dusty and terrible looking all around.  The food - the slight saving grace. Taste was decent, spread was average.  Facilities - not much to write about. There is a swimming pool that we did not use. You do not have Airtel connectivity. Only BSNL and Idea (not sure) work.  There are newer villas that are supposedly better. Could not check them as all were occupied.  To summarize, we checked in towards evening and were just waiting to get out of that place. 6k for a night for 2 adults and 1 kid is exorbitant for what they offer. Certainly not going back and would not recommend this to anyone. If at all you have to break at Kalasa, saw a decent looking hotel on the main road, near the temple. That",12
Raj S,Horrible place one would like to visit,Most horrible place to visit and stay with. Staff is very pathetic and rude. They charge so much but the cottages are in very bad conditions and food was bad too. Definitely not worth for the money paid for 3000/head. We stayed in a homestay before this place and it was really wonderful with great food and very co-operative staff. I would suggest please check appropriately before booking at this place,12
T R,FOOD AND HOSPITALITY IS FANTASTIC.MAINTAINENCE AVERAGE.Not worth the money paid for 3000/head.,Food and hospitality is fantastic. But the room maintenance is average. The bath rooms have not got proper shower arrangments and the beds were bad and you can see all types of insects in the morning when you open the bath room.it is due to the mosquito mesh not provided in the bath room window.,12
Guruprasad R,Vacation break turns into worst nightmare,"Pathetic place, sincere advise to fellow travelers. Look for alternatives, this place is run by novices to hospitality.  1. Value for money - no, not in terms of food or stay. Facilities - you will need to hunt for. 2. Hospitality - no, you will sorry for taking your family to such horrendous place. Guests are not welcome here, it's almost like paid pain torture 3. Courteous - no, this would have been part of previous section, but it deserves a separate call out. We happened to rely on bus instead of driving, so we ended up at this place 6am and we had checked with them about checkin but the sorry state of this place - its always crowded, at least front desk wanted us to believe. They gave is temporary place to freshen up and this place truly reflects the state of this home stay",12
Naveen G,Awesome place with lovely food,I would like to recommend this property for beautiful location and great hospitality.  great place with lots of greenery around one will fall in love with nature.

It is a quiet place ,mediocre in facilities. The staff is friendly and flexible. Food is ordinary with a malnad twist. There was this chicken curry with drum sticks which we all liked. For those who travel from Bangalore its a tiring drive through serene coffee estates after kottigere. Nature lovers would like this place and not entertainment lovers.",12
Ritesh A,Average place for one night stay,"We are a couple from Mangalore and were planning to spend the weekend to visit places around kudremukh. We booked this resort online.  Location: Its located around 17 km away from Kudremukh and 4 km from Kalasa on Kudremukh-Kalasa road. From the main road, a kachcha road goes up to the resort. There is no mobile network in this area. You ll get network only in kalasa which is 4 km from the resort.  Appearance: The resort is very ordinary looking. The reception is very average. The restaurant area is good. There is a campfire and a swimming pool near the restaurant. There are 4 categories of rooms - 1) Cottage, 2) Villa, 3) Tree house and 4) Ac Villa. The cottages are very small. Tree house is pathetic, uneven floor and incredibly small bathroom. We stayed in a Ac villa which",12
Laxmi K,Good for one night stay! Nothing extraordinary...,We visited this resort and found it to be of average in terms of hospitality and overall maintenance. Stayed in one of the rooms in the villa/cottage. Although it looks very beautiful from outside the rooms are pretty small for the price that you pay. Staff members are kind and courteous however the maintenance of room needs to be looked upon. For instance the bed sheets and pillow cover had lot of stains and were not washed i guess. No toiletries except for 2 medimix soap bar. Towels were damp. As far and food is concerned it was decent and I would like to compliment the chef for laying out a good spread of food. Campfire was good and the staff was quite helpful. Overall an average stay.,12

clementranjan,This could be your worst experience. Avoid,"After seeing on the reviews zeroed in on this place for our group of nine, which they call it a resort.  Pros: The location of this place in good on the Kalasa kuduremukha road.  Nearby to Kudremukh hanumangundi falls, Ambuthirtha and tea estate,Duggappana Katte.  Cons : The rooms are very old and terrible  Toilets are dirty with water leaking all around  The food is pathetic with stones and hair. They don't serve authentic food served in other homestays resorts but it's somewhat fast food. Only the breakfast was good.  The pool water is yellowish and the water was not replenished.  Al-carte menu is very expensive and not good. Pepper chicken was worst we had.  They don't put firecamp for your group separately instead gather everyone in the resort in one place and put the",12
SrikanthN45,Killing the scorching heat ‚Ä¶ to pour down in full glory!!,I decided to have a few days relaxation with family to kill the scorching heat of Bangalore and it simply meant life. I was just waiting for it; and the cool showers took away all the woes.  A moment of sheer joy forgetting the scorching heat and the hot summer.    The cottage we stayed had 2 spacious rooms with a sit-out.  It provided a commanding view of the surrounding and the fresh breeze that holding the temperature down during this hot summer.  We had fun taking splash in the swimming pool. Spent the late evening star gazing.  Not to mention the homely service and the sumptuous vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. I recommend you to taste the delicious Chicken Manchurian.    A great place for partying too! Thank you Silent Valley management and staff for the great,12

Ajay V,Liked the place,"I was in the resort for my long weekend.  I will first mention the bad things and then go to the good things.   1. There is no place to dry my clothes. So I gave it as a suggestion to the person. 2. My visit was one such weekend when it was hot. But they couldn't give us additional fans. 3. Not all employees are experienced so had a little trouble to get the route for ""Mist Valley"" 4. You can find any guides who can accompany you. 5. Pool water was a little dirty and itchy. 6. Construction work was still going on and my car was fully of red sand after I parked it. There is no closed garage also. 7. There are no sign boards so you can easily loose track.

Srividya G,Quaint resort nestled in a valley,"Amazing resort with comfortable cottages, and swimming pool. Finding the place was a little tough and be prepared for a lot of driving up the mountains.  Takes almost 3 hours to reach the resort. We reached the resort around 1030pm so was diffcult to locate at first plus renovation is going on so the entrance to the resort was dicey to locate. Anyway, after all the initial troubles, stay was excellent  and Stewart the in-house manager was a savior. Managed his staff very well, took good care of us and suggested sightseeing spots everyday to cover.

RobinAOwen,Overpriced for poor quality,"Firstly - Silent Valley is a misnomer. It is currently a building site, so ""possibly"" for the future it will improve, but at our visit 2 weeks ago one had to walk through the construction to get to reception with no path cleared. The initial room was a non-AC room tucked away at the back and not that clean or dynamic for 6,500 rupees. We upgraded to an AC cottage which was 8,000 rupees per night. When we got back to the room after dinner the AC was clearly not working and the quality of service given was pathetic at 8,000 per night. We were just given an AC remote which when we returned to the room did not work. The correct remote was given which did not work. This back and forth went on for some 2hrs until midnight.

We parked our vehicle at the entrance and scared even to get down as there was construction going on and there is no one to receive us except a young boy and the cook. 2.

Kunal D,Marriage Anniversary ruined,Quick bullet points  1) went with full family to celebrate my 5th marriage anniversary. 6 people  2) no security guards. 6 acre of property is being managed by 6 people  3) no network. Wify works only at the reception area. No phones in the room for service  4) stayed in the villa (their best bet)  5) top of villa is opened from from roof corner. All sort of insects come in to give you company.  6) attached bathroom has a big opening at the top.   7) windows do not get latched.anyone can creep into your room anytime.  8) swimming pool - filled with foam  9) no fence around the resort. Again major security issue.  10) some one scratched our car sides and management had no answer   If u want to creep yourself out and really want to spend a smelly night with family with zero,12

This is the condition given by Yoga to get a discount of Rs 2500. Total money paid Rs 22500 (for two cottage, for 6 adults)  Reached resort at 1 PM afternoon and it was completely mess. First no one at reception then they started searching for room keys.

I stayed in Villa but suggest that you opt for newly constructed villas which has better roofing than the old villas. Forget about cottages, there could be maintenance issues. Although, staff are responsive and very polite, I was made wait for 30 mins to check in and have to repeat my requests many times to get done. This place is closer to Hornadu temple and Kalasa Lord Shiva temple.

There are not much facilities for kids and one can get easily",12
Franchisu,Utterly Shabby,"Silent Valley Resort is the worst and the shabbiest place we have ever stayed.   The first impression of the resort itself gives you an unwelcome and sick feeling. The restaurant resembles a road-side dhaba. The swimming pool is more like a water tank. The rooms are badly built and poorly maintained. Furniture is awful. You have to make do with soiled/ used bed linen and towels. The tree house is a mess. In all, the resort is one big eyesore amidst a beautiful greenscape.  With no room service, no intercom, no cellular connectivity; this noisy, overcrowded resort-like down-market lodge charges you Rs.8,000/- per night [2 adults, 1 child] for an AC Villa!!    We had booked for 2 nights paying Rs.13,000/- in advance, but felt so choked that we decided to vacate a day earlier.",12

70shiv,Summer Holiday,"I went there with my school day friend, both Sr.Citizens. It was a pleasant drive from Mangalore through Kuduremukh. The reception was good and the cottages with tiled roofs were very cold at night so much so we had to change the cottage . The tree house was beautiful but was not available.  The ambience was good but the natural surroundings were excellent. I observed a lot of birds viz, the golden oriole, racket tailed drongo ,kingfisher ,turtle dove and many others.  Food was good but salty and oily. We gave our feed back to them  Its ideal for families, bored city people and elderly men like us to live in a secluded place like Silent Valley and discover serenity.",12
rajitb2015,"Not a pleasant experience - Frequent Water Shortage, Bathrooms not clean","I had booked a non-AC cottage for 2 days in the first week of April 2015. Booking experience was ok, some confusion in emails, but sorted out over phone. The person helped with directions to reach the place. But once we reached the place, there were multiple problems: - For our bad luck, there was some construction going on, for which there was a generator loudly blaring away - The cottage room was average, but the bathrooms were not well maintained - The food quality was average - The worst part was the lack of proper water supply to the rooms. In 1 day we faced water shortage 3 times and each time had to run out in search of people to get it fixed - The staff seemed helpless and clueless, looks like its a regular scenario and they seem frustrated too  I checked out after the",12
Prateek Mloi,"Pathetic rooms, too hot in summers no A/C and overprized","This resort is not in Chikmangalur, don't book this if you want to go there. Book if you are looking for some secluded place with nothing around only hills and silence. Ride to resort is hilly with too many hair pin bends and since we were driving we liked that piece. We had to wait an hour in hot weather before they prepared room for us. As journey to this place is tiering, you would want A/C in room if the temperature is a little on higher side.  We were highly disappointed by the quality of cottages for the price close to 5K. Food was ok, no issues on that, staff is good and polite.   Overall good drive, bad stay. Would never go back there again, if you want to go, go in winters or rainy season. Nothing in resort anyway, just enjoy weather and come back.",12
Sadhvi K,Beautiful place to visit,"It's a very beautiful Place to visit. Very peaceful and calm location. Food is really good and service is just awesome.. Staffs are very polite and helpful.. Cottages are very cute, we wanted to stay in a tree house but it was booked unfortunately.. This place is almost 350+kms from bangalore and there are two routes to reach there. You can call and check the fastest route with the manager he is very kind and will guide you very nicely. Should visit This place once.",12
Prashant T,Overpriced pathetic rooms and terribly inedible food,"First of all, this resort appears wrongly under the chikmagalur hotel and resort category, even though it is ~90km away from Chikmagalur.  We were a group of 2 families (4 Adults and 3 Kids) and wanted to go to Chikmagalur, but we ended up going to Silent Valley, Kudremukh as it was listed under the Chikmagalur resorts.  Apart from being far far away from our desired destination, the route to this place is really tiresome and sick as you have to travel around 40-50 km on hill roads. To add to that, the route is too zig-zag and contains a lot of hair ping bends which really makes most of the people sick.  Now coming to the real thing, the Resort. The resort people promised a lot of activities to us but the only activity or rather I should say the event that they organised was a",12
SKM73,Glorified resort....pls avoid,"From the picture you may think it to be an ideal retreat. But do not get fooled. I was given a cottage near a construction site as they are demolishing some structures and building new ones. The cottage itself was having linens that are not clean enough, no daily room cleaning.  The so called facilities like swimming pool, badminton and other play aids are just eye wash. Swimming pool is not maintained well, play aids are basic and worn out.  Overall the facility looks worn out and not maintained.",12
SreeBala2014,"Highly overpriced, Average","We booked a villa at Silent Valley due to unavailability at other resorts during the Jan 26th weekend. Having read most reviews on TripAdvisor, I was apprehensive about the place and arrived expecting total chaos.   The resort is housed amidst lush green surroundings. However, the ambiance and the entire construction speaks for the total disregard for the environment or aesthetics. This is a place for students or large groups who just want to eat, drink and be merry with singing and dancing late into the night.   This is not a place where you can expect some refinement. This is the sort of place where lot of students from nearby Mangalore, Manipal, Udupi turn up with friends. For a family like ours, it was a let down as it was too noisy in the night and we could hear the most",12
RangaHR,Nice Place and name indicates the resort is meant for silence and relax,"Recently, I had been to this place. Before booking, I was in panic. Many reviews rated bad about the resort. I tell you this resort is good and meets our expectations. It depends on how you receive it. If some one wants a lively urban atmosphere, this is not the right choice. If you want to relax and be away from official or personal worries, I advise, go ahead for this resort. Another good thing is your mobile is not reachable to others and you can make calls from the reception on emergency basis. This is allowed. Any resort in the world will not meet all of our expectations. There are couple of nice places around this resort. I think you will enjoy. Let me tell you I enjoyed with my family and kids. It was the same from my friend. Lastly, food taste was good and you can ask",12
AnkitGoyal17,Overpriced and under serviced!,"We were a group of friends went to Chikmagalur and booked our stay at Silent Valley Resort. I had some expectations from the resort after checking the reviews and pictures on various websites but all in vain.  The check-in time is at 12 noon, we reached at 2:45, still it took them over 40 minutes to get our rooms ready. On asking there was no reasonable explanation from the front desk guy.  Then we were escorted by a waiter to our rooms who was drunk like anything, yes in the middle of the day he was drunk, he had no idea where the cottages were located, we somehow managed to find the rooms by ourselves.  To our surprise the pictures made the rooms look something completely what they are not. One of the cottage toilet did not had light, the washbasin fixtures were loose and one",12
Nagendra R,Terrible place. Consider this if you have no other options,"We (family of 4) just came back from a 3-Night stay at the Silent Valley. The location is great. But that's about the only good thing we can say about this place. It's a completely dysfunctional place; hardly anything works well. The cottages are badly maintained. Poorly lit corridors, walkways make it unsafe for kids and elderly people. No intercom in the resort; that means you will have to shout at the din or run to the front desk area for any requests. The Tree House we were staying in was swaying all the time and it looked like it could collapse any time! And the best part is there was no place to take bath in the Tree-house!! There were snails, moths, lizards and all kinds of inselcts in the room and toilet. Rs. 8000 per night (all inclusive) is ridiculously high for this",12
alelisha,NOWHERE ELSE THAN SILENT VALLEY‚Ä¶!,"We had a team outing of 30 members to this resort during July last week. Cottages were clean and spacious enough to accommodate 4 of us in each room. Easily accessible as just about 100m meters away from main road and the resort team also took much interest in guiding us the proper route by sending detailed route direction. We should appreciate the resort team for serving us hot lunch though we reached very late at 3.30 p.m.  Food was really too good to increase our appetite. The food was unlimited. There was wide spread on buffet table. The center of attraction was the amazing pool they have. We really enjoyed a lot in swimming pool. To sum up it was really worth for the money we spent. They offered us very competitive rate of Rs.1,600/- per head for four sharing room with all",12

But one of my best friends suggested me this resort for my family outing with a huge group of 23 members. With great recommendation of my best friend, I landed on this property to enjoy with my family members. Believe me‚Ä¶! It was not at all as bad as it was described by few visitors. Of course there is much room for improvement of accommodation. But to be honest I really appreciate this resort team/ management for maintaining the resort in such a good condition even in this remote place.

bhavin0180,Bad experience with lovely weather,"We planned to stay here with family. Reached late rather then expected time where the ghat actually took more time to reach the destination. We had booked 4 top villa rooms. As we reached, it was heavily raining. Thanks to the staff who were waiting for us to reach and provided lunch in-spite of their closing time. Thanks to the staff again.   When we entered room, one room had water leakage from the roof due to heavy rains. In the other room, window were not getting close properly and as the place is within the hilly areas, obviously lots of mosquitoes and insects entering the room, especially when you are with small kids, its kind of risk.  Finally we settled with two different rooms then what we booked, but it took away our 3 hours of total. Both the rooms had no refrigerator",12
Raja P,AVOID THIS PLACE,"This is one of the most pathetic places i visited recently. The name says silent valley but its should have been horrible valley. The food served was the worst. So called buffet was served in small cups, no wide spread, worst hospitality, leaches, worms found in the toilet, badly maintained rooms with frequent power cuts, oldest TV with no proper channels to see.  Rather stay in a lodge if given an option. Wonder how the occupancy was good amidst this bad service.",12
daya199,Average,"Stayed in this property on 24-25 May with family. The location is fantastic with serpentine roads through the tea estates. However its about 2 hours from Chikmanglur town, The property has nothing much to talk about. Some rooms and a tree house apart from a pool. Place is really silent justifying its name. The facilities can be improved, Old small CRT TVs are still in fashion. Rooms have nothing much to talk about and yes you will find a few friendly insects in the room..   The food was fantastic every time without fail . The trek in the morning was fantastic, The hotel staff was absolutely fabulous too. However the core proposition leaves much space for improvement. Need to do a lot about the rooms standards and probably have a few more amenities around the area.. .I would not",12

Rooms are like horror movies filled with insects and bugs. Reception was very good but what is the use. I strongly recommend to improve this place properly and then invite people to stay in this resort",12

AdarshKS,A Home among the Mountains,"I planned my Honeymoon and a family trip here, it was an amazing experience. In the month of may it was pleasantly cool in the day and beautifully cold in the night. I had booked two villas for my family members and a AC room for me and my wife. The Resort is located in a very naturally scenic location and surrounded by lush greenery. The staff is very helpful. Please seek Mr Murthy if you require anything, He made our stay very pleasant. Please book villas or AC rooms only (preferably away from the pool). We had visited the resort between Monday to Wednesday and hence avoided the crowds. It was a nice and memorable trip with my family. I would recommend Silent Valley Resort to anyone who is planning to take a break from their busy schedule and want to just take some time off",12
Nagaraj R,Horrible .. absolutely no maintainance,"I had visited this resort in 2005 when it was fairly new and then it was good. With the same assumption I visited now April 2014.. and what we saw was shocking.  .. we were shocked to see the cottage allotted to us. It was horrible. The resort as such has not been maintained at all. The swimming pool has turned white (not cleaned). The dining room chairs are broken, no proper tables. The people there are really nice they themselves agreed it was not upto the mark. With the price they charge (Rs 4K per day  for kids).  We couldn't stay there .. we left the place with some loss.  Think twice, thrice or as many times as possible .. you really want to shell out that much and see this ??",12
mailspecies,Average,"An average experience. The cook from Mangalore was the only saving grace - graceful and concerned whether people had a good meal or not. The rest of it was just not on. Rooms filled up with all kinds of insects ( maybe the onset of rains), a hotel that shows signs of decadence, almost like someone had real estate and decided to put up a few bungalows and call them villa, tree house etc. Wouldn't stay there again even at half the price I paid. The scenic backdrop is another saving grace if one is really desperate to stay there.",12

The place turned out to be horribly maintained with cobwebs,hair and cockroach with broken walls leaking tanks, shabby dining area , no phone service to even call reception, plastic custtom made sinks, spiders in the tiny common bath toilet. Overall we could not stay there for couple of hrs also. Apparently rooms with ac dont work.  There is no signal to even call anyone except on one spot in the dining area. Food quality is bad too. Pool is not clean.  We booked another place with great difficulty online from that spot where we got the signal and left in 2 hrs. Not woth the money.",12

We also enjoyed some pool games and camp fire. Though it rained on 2nd night we had ended with rain dance. excellent service and clean place. Was total value for money.

ManojGarga,Worst Hotel to Stay In,We as a family of 4 (Husband & Wife and two daughters) booked this Hotel for an overnight stay. Booking was done through their Bangalore Office (Yoga / John). It was a disgusting experience. The rooms were not airconditioned and based on input from liars such as Yoga / John I had been up sold to their highest category Villa Rooms without being told that these rooms are not airconditioned. The furniture was shabby and of poor quality. In a two sharing room their were 4 beds rather than sofas that should be in a up scale room. The bed linen was of the most inferior quality possible. I walked out of the resort within an hour of reaching their. There is no decision making authority there and so they forfeited the sum they had collected for my stay there. My suggestion is that it is,12
chandu129,an avoidable experience,"the service, location and food are excellent.  the rooms are very, very basic. the infrastructure is real awful or rather non-existent. there is no approach road , just a dirt track. within the property the paths are in pitiable state.  apparently the management does not believe in a humane approach. only money matters. if a guest, having checked-in, takes ill and a premature check-out is necessary to seek medical aid, no refund is made. the resort is isolated and the closest good medical facility is at manipal.  they have your money, now you go fly a kite!  based on the quality of the rooms and the attitude of the management i would never ever stay there.",12

Deepak I,Good but may not go again,"The resort location is ideal, good for families and groups, caring staff, food is OK. The cottages are not up to mark, considering the tariff paid. There is a lot of room for improving the beauty, tidiness that will make the stay more comfortable. I agree that given the location of the resort, it is hard to control insects, leeches in the resort, but effort needs to be taken to keep the swimming pool clean and the frogs, grasshoppers, leeches away. I felt the staff there is overburdened and hence these things are ignored.  Not sure why they play ""Bhakti"" music all the morning and evenings. Its better not to play music at all given that some people would be looking forward to spend quiet and quality time in the resort amidst the forest.",12

This resort has old cottages with ethnic looks as well as modern cottages, with all the facilities. The staff  were courteous and the service was excellent. The buffet food  had varieties and was yummy. We were looking out for 1. Good Accommodation and food and 2. Peace and tranquility, which we got here.

During food service i was really worried about the hygene as most of reviwes spoke about it being unhygenic, but i saw that the plates and spoons and glasses were very clean. Food was homely and tasty but little spicy for me.   Also the swimming pool was very clean and hygenic. Finally i felt that it was worth the risk i took and yes really a value for money place.

Lot of greens around with wonderful view of fields. The food was simple and homely. The fish fry was very tasty. We stayed in the tree house which has a small seat out with the view of the volleyball court where we enjoyed a youngster group playing.

There are lots of places to see around. Resort is located in a scenic atmosphere, covered by paddy fields and views of thick forest.  Though we booked 2 cottages for 6 of us, they upgraded our stay, and allotted 3 cottages as there were fewer crowds as it was a week day. The staffs were very hospitable and were responding to our every need. The food was really delicious and was served with a smile on face by serving staff. They provided breakfast, lunch and dinner in the package itself. Food was unlimited and we got the hi-tea with snacks in the package itself.   We enjoyed the camp fire with melodious music.

jayduttk,Worst resort I will ever stay in this life!,"We rented a cottage at this place (201) for a long weekend i.e. (2 nights). To begin with the place looks nothing like what you see on the website- its totally dilapidated and gives you the feeling of staying in a servant's quarter. I am sure the staff working at the hotel also stays in similar accommodation that they have for their guests because I can't fathom any human being staying in a worse condition..   So here's my take on the place  1. Food - We found a mesh wire (used for cleaning plates) in the idli- however you could make out that the dishes, spoons etc.were just washed with water and had food remains on them...so makes me wonder what do they use the mesh wires for (obviously as an ingredient in the pathetic food that they dish up). Be prepared to eat the unconsumed",12
Dr Vikram V,Best to clarify on services at this resort,We just rented out three cottages at the resort. At first look the resort looks run down and badly in need of  a paint job. Also a lot of construction activity was on when we arrived. The cottages are cramped and damp with little or no ventilation. We stayed in cottage number 204 and this one had a bath room door that would not shut. Also The bed sheets and covers looked old and worn out.  Now the TV was not working and after repeated requests we got the service personnel to fix it. They finally they did it but 80 % of the channels had not been subscribed to.   To top that there are no phones in the cottages and one has to go to the reception every time you wanted something done.  Now to the food which was your average fare if you were studying in a medical college in Karnataka,12
venkyy17,"Excellent place, Kudremukh",We went for a team outing @ silent valley and the place was good. We stayed in 4/3 pax cottages which was good when compared to 2pax which is not good. Since we went in rainy season and was raining continuously for 16 hrs/day and crowd was less in the resort and we used the swimming pool to the full extent. The food was good and excellent that a plus point. Only we could not travel much due to rain where we could see only few places like dam and falls from the van.,12
Deepa V,Great place for team outing,"We had been with our team Kowni Technologies ,Bangalore on Friday night to Silent Valley and we had a real welcome from the resort team members.

Sudip B,"Nice experience with Silent Valley, Kudremukh, Karnataka","Excellent location, decent hospitality and staffs, tasty food.  Some suggestion for improvements:  1.  Putting road side banner/hoarding/direction from Kalasa would be good to locate 2.  Include some activities in the evening time 3.  Bit of maintenance required for the swimming pool water 4.  Intercom/Room service is essential 5.  Poor mobile network  Regards \Sudip",12
ArindamDas,Reasonably good,"We stayed in this place twice in past few years. The cottages are rustic - be ready to meet frogs and snails in the bathroom. The food is good. The location is peaceful unless you have large groups staying there - it can get very noisy and swimming pool can get very crowded. Though it is green all around, there are no great views from the resort; you need to drive towards Kudremukh for that. It's good for corporate offsites / team building as there are playgrounds and open space.",12
praveengkumar,Peace!!!,"I stayed in Silent Valley from the 29th to 31st of Mar'13. The cottages are designed well and it was clean. While the food was good (especially Rice and Rasam :), I feel the non veg could have been better. Was expecting a spread of Malnad cuisines but got to taste only two specialties.  The staff's were very helpful and please note that there is no network connectivity (except IDEA) in case you plan to use your cell phone. There is a phone that can be used though (they did not charge for the calls).  Roads are pretty good, however a stretch of 20kms is very bad and we cannot blame the resort for that. Overall I would rate this place 4.  Cheers!! Praveen Gopinathan",12
deepnat,Family time,The trip was amazing as Silent Valley Resort welcomes you with a wonderful warm staff. Children feel very special as they are taken care of. The Swimming pool is neat and well maintained. Kudremukh national park is right next to the resort and the greenery and the scenic view is just amzing. Food was also good. I am a vegetarian so had the salads and the curries with coconut garnish (Malnad cusine) and the kids and my husband are non vegetarians and liked the fish and the chicken. I wont call it a very high end cottage but it is a decent place for the price we pay for the cottage. Mainly we got good sleep :),12

We stayed in the midst of the jungle in the Hut, but, with all facilities inside and the weather was too good in May also.The interiors of the hut was decorated with Rajasthani paintaings and one could feel the touch of the Village and too relaxed from the hustle and bustle of the cities. One must go there, discover,enjoy..and we went to one of the jungles..not able to recollect the name..Very Adventorous with the LEECHES there..but, overall, the journey to Kudremukh was awesome.",12

We were quite anxious after reading online negative reviews about this property. The discount as we got for corporate and off-season booking increased our doubts. Well, well.. well.. we reached Silent Valley only after 8+ hours journey from Bangalore. In between we called up the manager asking for directions and he assured to keep lunch ready for us no matter how late we reach. Though we booked standard villas but were accommodated in premium ones :-)  The hospitality and services were as lovable as the food esp. non-veg. The pool was somewhat dirty but it didn't discourage us to get the splash. The best part of tour was early morning trekking to nearby hill with breathtaking heavenly vista. Last but not",12

We checked in at nine pm and the staff were briskly as if we are checking in morning time.  Dinner was sumptuous with almost five veg dishes!! Combination of dry and with gravy. It was homely.   We retired telling we shall have our bed tea at seven.  Five am when I got up just to take a view of misty morning someone from the kitchen eagerly asked whether I need Tea!. That was nice to hear .  We had again filling breakfast and left after usual photo op of the resort.  Checkout was also smooth. Mr. Murthy was very hospitable and took good care of us.  Mr.john who is managing the project is a kind and simple person.He personally came and collected the advance,12
mrrahulghosh,A base for lovely drives,The drive from Bangalore to Kalasa in Chikamagalur district may be long but the climb through the Western Ghats is picturesque. Kalasa is close to 350 km from Bangalore and it took us 7 hours to get to our destination. We took the Bangalore-Mangalore highway upto Hassan and then took the state highway to Belur. From Belur we continued to Mudigere and then started the climb through the ghats to reach Kalasa.  The resort is situated in a valley just off the road. The place is supposed to be an ecotourism resort. The reception and dining place is quite basic. There is quite a few areas demarcated for sports activities such as volleyball and swimming. There is a dedicated space for bonfire in the evening. The cottages and villas are spread around across the plot (and the plot is,12

visitroja,Life was so silent In silent Valley :),I had a wonderful weekend with my family last weekend. We were very much pleased with the behavior of the staffs and their available at any time attitudes. Mr Murthy in Dining time and Mr Umesh from front desk gave us all the support.  The food was delicious and never made us feel away from home. It made us feel heavenly the whole weekend.  My kind request to you to make aware of  your staffs to have a rule for bachelors not making too much noise around the cottages after 11 pm as we are disturbing the animals around the forest and the people sleeping in the cottages :)  Swimming pool had not much privacy once you pull corporate guys to pool. Everybody should have a chance to swim hence it should be given a time limit for every groups.  Intercom facility will bring more,12

Food is average Positives:- 1. location 2. Hospitable staff I had to pay the whole booking amount at one go to confirm the booking. Moreover, it was really sad that they agreed to give us cottages knowing that plumbing work was not proper in one of the cottages (it was not informed earlier).

I must say hats off to the management of this resort for the way they brought up the improvements in the whole structure. First time when I visited in 2006, it was just okay. Still I liked the simplicity of this resort and the amazing beauty of this place. My second visit was in 2009 during Independence day. It was much more than my expectation compared to my earlier stay. But this time after 3 years, it was just amazing. They have come up with new villa and air conditioned accommodations.

The cleanliness was at its peak. To my surprise after finishing our breakfast when we come back to our room, we found our cloths kept folded which we thrown here and there.

There are ample facilities if you don't want to go out for sightseeing and spend a day in here as they have a decent swimming pool, volleyball court, bonfire arrangements and an open dining area with a shed right in front of the pool. The cottages also look quite asthetically built from outside, can't say the same when it comes to inside though.

The food was excellent, the traditional buffet with local dishes made me miss home. The most what i liked was the ethnic old cottages...they are so cold and cozy and its nice to sit at the sit-out at night and enjoy the view.

The cottages are clean and so is the linen. The service team is excellent and was responding to our requirements immediately.   While we thought of some uplifts in the amenities, the good news heard was that the resort is being renovated and should be all done by September 2011.

We wanted to stay close to nature and spend a quiet time away from the madding crowd. So, I will not go about complaining about insects and bugs.

Tariff is also reasonable as they worked out it for just Rs.1,450/- per head with all meals and taxes as a corporate offer under sharing basis. To be honest as per my enquiry with other home stays in that location this is the best deal what they offered. Over all we had a wonderful time.

This made me realize that they were not prepared to host us at all. 2. We checked in late in the evening and it was dark and raining, they had lost power and did not have the generator running till we got there, we went to the lobby using a flashlight. 3.

We needed low spice diet food for elders - which was catered to, and we also got fries (on request) for the kids. Special needs were communicated to the resort crew and we had hot lunch as we reached the place. There is a hill right behind the place that we explored ( to me that was the highlight) while the kids enjoyed the pool, photographers and bird watchers also have a a fair chance of getting a good snap. We requested for additional beds to cater to the our group but the cots could have been better, and watch out there is no cell signal there - which was a good thing for us to switch off.",12

The excellent food and the helpful service staff made us feel very good since we wanted to have a relaxed time without bothering about where and what to eat next.

Making a Booking : For being situated in a not so popular tourist destination, they are very finicky about receiving ""full payment"" upfront before they can send you a confirmation voucher. If you are so particular about receiving money you should have more payment options.  2. Reaching there & first impression: Whether your spouse blames you for choosing this resort or no, your tyres would certainly do. The entry to the resort is so pathetically maintained even a Hummer would nt help you.  A dilapdiated half torn display board of silent valley welcomes you - claiming to be Home ""away"" from home in wrong English. If I wanted Home in the",12
SV-Adiga,Wonderful experience in Silent Valley,"Silent Valley is a wonderful resort for those who would like to spend time with in the nature. Especially those who would like to have a superb experience with their spouce should visit this resort during winter season especially December. You can see the beauty of Malenadu with full of mist, coffee & plantations & just greenery every where. The Silent Valley team treats guests like their family members & their hospitality is fantastic. The tree house, food served during our stay, their care and understanding of our needs made the stay an unforgettable memory. Special thanks to the staff for their marvellous service.",12
Oscar Dsilva,Hardly silent and far from a resort,"Long weekend coming up and we were yet to make a booking. Heard about this resort from a friend and checked the reviews on Trip Advisor before making the reservation. Was a bad decision all the way! When the sales man hurried us to book the last 5 ""cottages"", we didnt expect the 'WORST"" five!  Price was low and included all meals - but we didnt expect rooms to be shabby, with unkempt bathrooms and slime on the tiles, broken wash basins and stained buckets and mugs. Bed linen was musty and not changed until next day despite requests! The resort claims to be an eco resort - seemed that way as we found caterpillars on the ceilings and in the dimly lit bathrooms of each cottage. 1 hour after checking in, a stray dog entered one of our rooms and ran away with a bag full of snacks!...",12
Naresh,Utter silence,"This is a place you love to visit if you do not want to get those big city busy hassles.  Absolutely in the lap of nature devoid of all interrupts.

Its ideal places for mountain trekking, forest walk, and many more places to see around Kudremukh.  One best experience was trekking organized by Silent valley after wonderful walk up the hill we experienced as we walking in the sky and top view of near by villages and mountains and walked through small houses on the mountain and estates then we stayed at Silent valley and organized camp fire and barbeque at the resort for night.  The way to the resort has small water falls and water ponds on the road side its fun to play there.",12
Bhatkya,Homely atmosphere - Good if you want to away from City Life,"Tough it is called as resort, it's long way to go to become real resort. It's a place where you can have nice time with your family. Don't expect facilities which you probably think of when resort word comes to your mind. Plus - the service is excellent, Food is homely with less spices ( different than usual panjabi dishes), the area where it is situted is Awesome, The weather was nice Minus - Lack of facilities to pass the time if you want to spend full day inside resort, Poor or No Maintenance, Lack of professional approach (This works both ways  )",12
I M,"Not so silent, not very good","This resort has the right idea but fails to implement its aims in terms of accomodation and food. Cottages were basic, with broken window screens allowing all manner of insects into the room. Bathroom was filled with slugs. Food gave us an upset stomach, the only one in weeks of travelling through India. And, while not the fault of the resort, a neighbouring cottage played loud dance music through most of the night. It would have been good to see a greater presence of resort staff. Avoid this one if you can.",12

The resort is in a run down condition. lack of maintenace can be seen every where - Right from the entrance gate (which has corroded away), to leaking roofs, unusable swimming pool, and broken down chairs in the dining room.   I went their just before summer, and even with light rains, the tiled roof was leaking - and it was not a small leak, water was just pouring in. The bathroom fixtures (Towel stand, taps) are in a bad shape and hardly usable.   After staying in the place for one night, we decided to leave the place out. The place was totally rotten. I would strongly recommend others to avoid this resort.",12

We had few beers and hard beverages, called on the bill and was surprised rather say was shocked to see the rates abnormally very high, the waiter said this is how the system works here anyways we wanted to quit dinner as the bill itself took everything out of what we drank, hahahaha !!! but we were compelled to have dinner by the service staff which was quite rude, overall experience was average but as i said its a club and expectations have to be limited!!",13
Shabin S,Opening for your lungs and eyes,"You drive thru the Chikmangalur town and take this small village road towards the club. You go thru farms besides you and come to a slope and you can spot expanse of lush greenery. You get out of your vehicle and breathe in that lovely crisp air. As like all clubs in India, everything is on a slow pace, so if you wish, do it on your own.  The Main club house is renovated by the Taj group of hotels and cricket doyens like Kumble and Dravid have frequented the place. Awesome flora and its a treat to your eyes. If you like walking, take a walk in the greens and that too in the morning to see lovely bird life and cries of the bird from all sides.

The food is simple and very average for which they charge 200 per vegetarian guest which again is over priced.  The staff are not very courteous when we pointed out their shortcomings and also they refused to give the telephone number of the Secretary of the club with whome  a complaint could be registered.  There are no fans in the lounge and reception  and dining areas and in hot summer its unbearable to sit .,13

First of all, people who are going for leisure, there are no amenities like swimming pool or indoor/outdoor games, even golfing comes at a cost. Don't have high hopes of service and class as the name looks like. Despite booking 2 rooms, 10 days in advance, rooms were not serviced properly.1st room's AC was not working and I was given another small room to occupy. Later on, that other small room's AC also stopped suddenly. Entire 1 day was wasted out of 2 days I stayed because of this sad plight, as it was so hot and was staying with a baby. Rooms were of different sizes but you could very well differentiate the facilities given in a big room v/s small room. Big room - LCD, AC, extra sofa cum bed with a reasonably extended",13

Overall a very good experience for a short golfing stay!,13

jagga,Wonderful Location. Poorly maintained golf course,The golf club is located in a beautiful location. The view while playing on the 18 hole golf course is simply amazing. The course needs a lot of maintainence. Especially the greens. They were so bad that the joke was to use a driver on the green instead of a putter. The club house and rooms are very good. The food was average. The staff are courteous and well trained. Can be a great golf destination if the course is properly maintained.,13

NiruJ,A lovely stay!,"It was one of those long weekend and even the smallest 'motel' (if I may use the word in the Indian context) in and around Bangalore was booked. Thankfully, we were able to find vacancy in Chikmangalur Golf Club and to be honest, it is the best thing that happened. They have 5-6 rooms and are located a little away from the city but not as far as the home-stays. That made it convenient and the club itself was quiet because of the limited rooms available. The rooms are large and spacious and the food is good. It overlooks the hills rich with plantation and ideal place to idle.  There isn't much to do in the club if you don't play golf and if you do, it's a great course.",13
Vindy22,Awesome place,Rooms are large and have beautiful views of the golf course from the balconies. The highlight is the food. Their wine chicken is to die for.

We had a very good pre-dinner in the nice veranda on the golf course, and then a proper dinner (of not great quality) inside. The real problem was the night. People talking till late in the night, didn't allow us to fall asleep, and then dogs, bird and windows without shutters did the rest, keeping us awake all the night. The real problem was the breakfast, we had it very early in the morning and the breakfast room had not yet been cleaned, so we've eaten a very poor breakfast in a dirty room. Price was pretty cheap, but far too high for the service received.",13
Pratish M,Needs a lot of improvement,"Had high hopes going in to the Chikmagalur Golf club, thanks to experiences in other golf clubs in India. A not-so-pleasant experience awaited us...  Well, the rooms were OK - clean etc. Lots of open space and such, in and around the room. But that's about it - the good part.  We probably chose the wrong time to go - the greens are being relaid and therefore the whole experience of staying in a golf club was lost. I guess we should have asked, but then come to think of it, the staff could have warned us during booking as well.  The food is nothing to talk about - very poor choice and hugely overpriced. Come to think of it, the room was actually overpriced as well. We had to beg and plead with them to get an extra plate (weren't successful with that). The staff kept messing up",13
Vandana,Could be better,"We stayed at the golf club for two nights in December. The rooms are spacious with a little balcony where you can sit and admire the view. They weren't cleaned properly, also the management could look at changing the outdated tv sets. The bathroom were clean and ok.  When we were staying at the club, there was a large group of noisy people, who were annoying after some time. Management didn't do anything to check their noise levels.   The service is a little slow, though the staff is helpful. My biggest disappointment was with the food and kitchen. For the price the club asks for the rooms, you could stay at a good homestay with all meals provided. The club does not even offer complimentary breakfast.The only option for dinner was a buffet which was below average.No ala carte",13

Its location is beautiful. and if u are interested in treking u can even get a guide to climb the hill. greenery and serenity around this property is mesmerising.Currently the golf course is getting prepared so there is loose soil which is getting messy due to rains but I think once the work is over it will be a beautiful place.,13
Karthik V,Good Value for money,"I travelled with family (a group of 12) to this location. I think you can get reservations only if you know someone who is a member of the club. Just a few kms away from the town of chikmagalur. A spectacular location with hills on every side of the property. It was monsoon(July 2012) when we visited, but the rains were scanty and helped clear up the air. Once the sun came out, the property had some awesome views.  Very calm, quiet, no frills atmosphere. The restaurant was clean and food was reasonable. My kids loved being outdoors. For about Rs. 3000 a night, the rooms were well maintained.   I would highly recommend this place, if you're looking for some peace and quiet. A few hilly vista points are less than an hour's drive from here.",13

Few things people should be aware of as tourists.  - You should maintain silence meaning there will be golf happening other side so they expect guests not to be loud. - You cannot wear even long shorts to the restaurant area.This is applicable only for guests. Members of the golf club can wear anything. - This club is in the foothills of the mountains nearby - Dinner is after 9.30 PM, Breakfast is after 9.00 AM  The above all to be strictly adhered.

They agreed & said that they will be refunding in a week's time - I shared my account details. It has been a full two months and multiple follow ups have been done for such a small amount - but no luck.

maneeshlodhi,Hotel Aadrika Chikmagalur - Overall decent experience,"I have visited Chikamanalur with family during Christmas - along with another family & friend.  Pros - We found hotel Aadrika centrally located at downtown with all facilities available nearby. Hotel rooms and related infra is good.   Cons - Breakfast room at third floor has some serious issues. First and foremost is the table-chairs clothes liners are extremely dirty hence must be cleaned or replaced immediately.  Supporting Staff needs more training. Services and Food served in Restaurant especially at Ground floor , I guess Vivitika, was very poor . Guest needs to pay each and every request they will make and one will not be given any discount or rebate.  Overall , Hotel is good , centrally located, rooms are good but one has to avoid eating there in the hotel as much better",2
Preethi,Best staff and location of hotel.,"Best part of hotel is staff from security,travel desk and reception.They make sure to give proper support as requested.  I travelled to Chikmagalur and opted for aadrika. I feel now it's best decision I made while booking. They made arrangements for cab for local sightseeing where cab drivers also very prompt and professional. Also they packed early breakfast while leaving for sight seeing around 6AM.  Regarding room also neat and clean.worth for amount paid  Thanks aadrika team for making my trip memorable.",2
VIKAS Bhatnagar,PATHETIC CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ONLY COMMERCIAL MINDED STAFF,"Hotel is big and rooms are spacious, Location is also pretty good however I will never recommend this hotel due to below reasons:  PLEASE DONT VISIT THIS HOTEL WITH FAMILY OR FRIENDS TO AVOID EMBARASSING CUSTOMER SERVICE  1.they don't know anything about customer service and courtesy. Only 2 service staff available in whole restaurant during breakfast on a peak season day ie 25 th Dec. They didn't know how to manage guests and were doing both cleaning and order taking tasks. I ordered for a masala dosa that didn't arrive at all.  Omlette was also delivered after almost 15 mins and that too with almost 3-4 reminders.Breakfast time is till 10.30 am however quite a few items like fruits, Salad, breads ( bhatura), were already finished by 9.30 am only.

Had booked Balcony Suite which was very spaciousfor 2 & had a beautiful view of mountains. Food was awesome esp.chicken biryani. Breakfast spread was decent and tasty.  Improvements: 1. Room cleaning should be done in the presence of guests or with the consent of guests in their absence irrespective of 'Do not Disturb' option. 2. Service response time should be expedited  Overall, the stay was pleasant and the property is well maintained. Keep up the good work..",2
Rabi_13,Excellent property at Chikmagalur,We stayed in this property during our recent trip to Chikamagalur. Property is near the main street of the town. Tourist taxi stand and auto stand are beside the hotel. I  stayed in suite room with breakfast option. Room is big and super clean. They are taking good measure of covid protocols at least in rooms and lobby. As it's in town so dont expect valley view however from reastaurant you can have a view of the western ghat. Multi cuisine restaurant Zesto serves quality which is good in taste. Breakfast buffet spread is good. It's having a cafe and a pure veg restaurant as well. Ample parking space is there. Rooms are having all the modern amenities. Linens and comforter is cozy and clean. Overall a wonderful stay. Recommended for other travellers.,2
SHANAVAS BAVU,The best hotel available in Chikmaglur for business or leisure travel,"This is a resonably new property with spaceous and very clean  rooms. Balcony rooms are excellent to stay. The vegetarian restaurant - Vivikta - has very good menu and delicious food.  The buffet breakfast is rudimentary and lacks spread, but tasty.  Service levels and staff courtesy are moderate, can be improved; at the restaurant especially.   The hotel has a very large courtyard around the building that is very useful to have a peaceful and relaxed morning / evening walk.  By all means, this is the best and value for money hotel in Chikmaglur.",2

Vikram Kamath,Large well maintained rooms. Average service.,"The check-in process was slow as they were not able to find my booking at the reception.  The rooms were spacious and well maintained. All equipment inside the room worked perfectly. They provided extra bed on time. The coffee provided in room service was cold. The service in the restaurants were slow. They werent showing up to even hand the menu cards. This is understandable as it looked like they were running low on staff due to Covid situation. Hopefully the service will improve in future, as we liked this hotel in all other aspects.",2
DebayanBhattacharyya,A quick get away destination from Bangalore,The stay was calming and extremely peaceful.

The 3 Star Hotel offered us the best service possible. The courteous staff made the stay pleasant as well as the free trip advices were useful for us.

Most hotels in this range appeared the same from the pictures they posted. But we went with Aadirika Hotel based on gut feeling.   Aadrika turned out to be better than what we imagined and even better than what you see in the pictures they put up.   1) Located right in the middle of the city but away from main-road so no roadside noise. 2) Enough parking, spacious lobby, excellent security, very friendly personnel.  3) Very well maintained premises with 5-star comparable rooms -- spacious and clean.  4) Choice",2

The room faced the hotel entrance, had a lot of trees, with birds flying all across the sky - the sight was good.  Breakfast was included in the deal, as it should always! Food was tasty, and fresh. We chose room dining for dinner, which probably was a mistake. The restaurant in the 3rd floor had a pleasant ambience.

Vinoth S,Pretty satisfactory!,"I could complain about the food cost but that's a small dent in our overall experience which was quite comfortable and relaxing. Located right beside the bus terminal, you can venture out for budget restaurants if one feels their food is expensive. But we were impressed with the taste. There are differences between a homestay with its view and a hotel with its comfort. This is of the latter category and we definitely enjoyed the stay.",2

If by chance your kids soil their linen, they will make you pay for the replacement.Overall the hotel is very neat and clean, but does not have gym equipment since it is hardly one year old. Food quality is acceptable and morning breakfast is good on the weekends - weekdays they economize based on the number of guests staying in the hotel - hence avoid weekdays,They have strict rules on which direction you should park your car and the security guy ensures that you exit the hotel in a particular manner.Mattress is very hard - probably meant for old persons with back injuries.They overcharge you also for the local sight seeing - if you book through them.Hence take limited help from the hotel.Also do not",2

The hotel has a very high end feel to it. The staff is very well mannered and helpful. The in-house restaurant is very good and has good quality food. The room we stayed in was very spacious given that a spare was also added. The washroom was also good but a little short on space but still had very good fittings. We had check in time at 2 PM but we reached at 3:30 AM in the night ie 10 hours early but they checked us in. After our stay we had to check out at 12 PM but we asked them to extend it for 12 hours and they did. They obviously took extra charges but at least didn't ask us to leave.

It also has a restaurant which has bar and food- with veg and non-veg items. Our breakfast was complimentary and it had a good array of items. We took a family room which was specious. Housekeeping and reception staff was prompt. They have a tourist desk also which guides for local seeing options. Overall value for money.

Both food and tariff is on the higher side and food isn‚Äôt the best. However options for food are limited if you are looking for cleanliness and hygiene.

I was upset because of stain marks in the toilet which was cleaned as soon as I reported.  I was upset because, I could not find shampoo while taking shower, towels were not sufficient.

When we informed the reception, they tried to fix it and then quickly offered us a replacement room. So, although this caused a bit of irritation, it was quickly resolved. The rooms were clean and quite spacious. The rooms don't have any view, but then that's not even expected since the hotel is right in the middle of the city. The complimentary breakfast spread was quite good in terms of variety. Although we didn't like the fish fingers which were cold and not very tasty, the rest of the breakfast was good.

aryan_kasturi,Not worth your holiday,"Did a one day trip family trip. It was a series of disappointments. First thing very striking is lack of any view from the room. The windows open to show a glimpse of busstand and a cinema. The view to any mountains is completely blocked. When visiting a hill station for a vacation, this is something you keep craving. Second the room is small. It was barely sufficient. I was expecting a larger room with some balcony for the price they charge. Third lack of necessary stuff in room: No hair dryer, no dustbin in the room, given only one soap (not even a shower gel). High time management realizes a second soap is a necessity. Fourth the Mini fridge does not work. Kept a bottle of soda overnight and still it was not cold. Idling in the room itself could have made it cold. Fifth: No",2

I  was booked two non ac rooms on the first night as all the ac rooms were full. Later next day had booked AC Rooms through Travel Portal., Rooms are comfortable and cozy. May be they need to look into providing four pillows instead of two which are being provided. Two Medium soft and two soft. The AC's need to be looked into as the cooling was not appropriate even after I was moved to Proper AC rooms. The water pressure needs to be higher, perhaps they might not have switched on pressure Pump. Food and bar is good. Little flexibility can be provided in terms of number of complimentary mineral water bottles per nights stay.  The hotel is close to nearby",2

Firstly stayed there for 2 days and there was a problem with the air conditioning where we did not have air conditioning at all in the whole first floor. Chikmagalur itself is quite a cool place and hence we were able to manage.   The other issue is that there is no manager available to address the issues and everything is left up to Junior employees to address so that if there is any problems they are the people facing the wrath of the customers.  Some of the staff in the dining area also have a little attitude where most of them are really good. There is one North Indian guy who behaves like he is doing everyone a favor.  The food they serve is very tasty but a little on the expensive,2

Negatives -  --------------  We had very bad experience with Housekeeping staff. In the Day 1 we found our bed was not cleaned at all. The bedsheet and the blanket had the traces of previous guests.    Housekeeping staff don't know how to prepare the room. I need to call them to get the new soap after it's finished.   They don't change the towel regularly. Keep the same,2

VinoOne,Nice resort for relaxing,"The resort is wonderfully designed and with good views around. Pros Nice location with a view of the mountains around. The location is kept clean The room's are cleanly maintained The staff is very helpful. Sachin and Ranjith's services are good, and the nature walk guide Apeksha is exceptional. He has got an excellent sound knowledge of the fauna and flora in the resort.  Cons The restaurant is pathetic. Only the buffet breakfast is ok. None of the dishes we ordered for room service is good. it is totally bland. There is no choice as there are no restaurants nearby. There are not many toilet /room accessories kept for the amount they charge for the rooms, only the basics are kept also in the room as well.  If you are opting for a nature walk, wear thick socks and good shoes as",3

We were one of maybe two families at the resort. Yet, the staff made sure that there is no deficiency in the service. Always eager to help out with a smile.

Purely going by the online reviews, we narrowed down on Honeydewwz Exoticaa Hotel & Resort. My first thought of arriving at this resort was pleasant and comforting. Right from the security personnel to housekeeping staff everyone was hospitable and courteous. The reception staff were welcoming and took care of the check in formalities. We opted for a Bourbon mountain view room and were sweetly surprised by the large spacious rooms, cleanliness and location of the rooms. The view from this room was just fantastic. Food is brilliant!

Mitalee,Review of visit June 19th to June 20th,Resort Ambience - 5 Facilities - 5 Maintenance- 5 Food - 2 Staff - 1 Overall Hospitality - 1  By my above ratings it is very clear that we didn't feel welcomed at Honeydewz Resort Chikmangalur. The place is so beautifully made and constructed that it is worth a mention that the owners have put in a lot of their heart and soul. But a hotel for me is worthless if the Hospitality and staff attitude is zero. Though the staff was good in their place but they have been rather trained to disrespect their guests by turning down all the requests.  Points to be noted : -  1.) No one at the entrance to welcome. We had to walk with our baby up and down from the parking to call the person to take our luggage to the room.  2.) No assistance in cleaning baby utensils or serving baby related,3

The cottage was filled with all kinds of facilities with a good view of garden and mullayanagiri hill range behind the resort. All cottages in here are air conditioned and the bathroom was clean & hygenic. Strangely when we checked into the room the tap was closed at the bottom of sink.

I could not find a single flaw. Minutest details like Non veg items kept separate from Veg dishes and a log book kept inside the drawer with a checklist, shows how much they care for their Guests. The cottages are located bit far from the Restaurant but we stayed in a Log Hut which was much more convenient. Each hut has a superb view of River Bhadra backwaters.

The backwaters are clean and we did water activities post morning safaris... Beautiful to swim and relax. The resort is also well spread out with great views from the loghut and cottage. Cottage room is slightly bigger than loghut. We stayed in loghut 7,8 for a night and then obliged to switch over to a cottage for 2 nights as one of the group had older people who could not handle the long uphill/downhill from the cottage. So, be careful when you book the room. We got lucky with safaris as Bhadra is not known for good sightings... We got 2 different sightings of leopards and one sighting of 2 sub-adult tigers. Few new raptors as well in the boat safari. Jungle has good views, but sparse wildlife as there is plenty",4
TravellingWizard,Most Relaxing Family Holiday,"I had visited River Tern Lodge for 2 days in the second last week of December with my mother, son and wife. We drove from Bangalore and the roads were a pleasure to drive on. Our entire travel time was 5.5 hours (303 kms) with a 30 min break. We had packed a lot of sweaters but the weather was quite sunny and hot. However, the jackets and shawls did come in handy during the early morning jeep safari into the forest.   We stayed on the island (which is across the cable bridge) in cottages 14 and 15 but the walk and the climb was too strenuous for my mother. The log huts on the mainland are slightly smaller than the cottages and these are quite close to Gol Ghar - the restaurant. One would still have to climb up from the main reception, boat safari or water games to reach these.",4

Activities at this resort include 2 hour evening safari into Bhadra tiger reserve as well as 2 morning boat safari in the backwaters.

There is not a single dull moment throughout the day with 2 safaris, water sports, bonfire, movie, bar and 4 times food and snacks.

Surrounded by trees and chirping birds, you can feel you tiredness just melt away. Thought to answer a few questions which we had till we got here: - Loghuts are closer to the dining are and cottages are a little far (almost a 500m walk). We were in the loghuts and got the loghut 6 which had good views.

Sunshine52891603119,Unforgettable tryst with tiger (and gaur),"River Tern is modestly appointed at best. While some things can improve especially on the housekeeping front, many things are just perfect. The food is simple, wholesome, creative and very tasty. The staff do their best to accommodate your requirements, including packing a lunch for the return trip back which is not included in the package. But most of all, we will remember River Tern for the experience we had yesterday, on a  cool and misty Thursday morning. After an afternoon jungle jeep safari and two boat safaris (one morning and one afternoon) that didn't yield much other than a peacock with open feathers and an elusive crocodile, we made a last attempt in the jungle. And were rewarded first, with a view of elephants, and then of a massive gaur and a tiger in a face off.",4
Anindya D,Tern River Lodge for 2 D/2N,"After reading quite a lot on the web, we decided to give the JLR resort in Bhadra Tiger Resort a try. Having visited Kabini and Bandipur, this was in our list of forests to cover in Karnataka and boy, was it worth it. First of all the accommodation was really nice. We stayed in the log huts which are nearer to the reception and dining area. The cabins are a bit further out and probably nicer but if you have elderly people in your family I would avoid it as it would involve numerous up and down trips for them. BTW, the cost is same for both. The log cabins by themselves were quite nice; they were clean, spacious and had a balcony with spectacular views of the reservoir. The staff were extremely nice and helpful and the food quite good; standard JLR stuff. The safari and boat",4
Vijaykumarb,Very good place to stay ... can have better rangers to better the safari... Ofcourse overpriced,We were there for the year end break and had a wonderful time with family... one of those best places of the JLR properties.  They planned it well with one boat and one jeep safari.  Food is really good and the staff are very courteous.,4
Gauri,One of the best experiences at JLR,"The River Tern Lodge is a Jungle Lodges and Resorts property, located on the banks of the Bhadra reservoir. This was our first visit to this particular resort and the experience was as good as any other JLR property. We stayed in a cottage, which had a spectacular view of the Bhadra backwaters. The bridge crossing and climb of roughly 150 steps each time to reach the cottage was totally worth it for the view. The room was spacious, air conditioned and quite comfortable. The itinerary as usual was jam-packed. After check in and lunch, we went for a jeep safari into the Bhadra reserve. The roads are a bit primitive and there was a spell of rain during the safari. The jungle was verdant and we saw the usual spotted deer, sambar, wild boar and our first sighting of a monitor lizard",4
Paul Daishin,The Rangers are not professional,If you compare Kabini with this place then this is below average as the rangers are inexperienced and the safari is not well coordinated as in Kabini. I am not sure why all the JLRs do not operate same as Kabini? Surely the people running this chain can connect all of them and provide the same experience.   This visit was sheer waste of time ...we could spot so many rare birds in the land safari and we had to forcefully stop the driver so that I can take a pic. They just didn't have a clue of anything!!!,4
Vivek K,Your best chance to spot a BIG CAT!,"There are few places where you get an unforgettable experience. Our visit to the River Tern Lodge was one of those mesmerizing experiences. The booking process was hassle free and our early checking request was considered as the rooms weren't occupied the previous day.  I have visited 5 JLR properties before this one and must say that this property has the best staff and food options. They cater to all your personal needs and tastes, cook some fantastic food and always serve you with a smile. A big THANK YOU to Venkatesh and his team. In terms of activities, we were completely occupied during our stay with water sports, jeep safari and boat safari. While the boat safari and water sports gave us a chance to enjoy the bhadra backwaters, the highlight of the trip was the jeep",4
Madhuri R,Absolutely worth it!,"This is probably one of the best jungle lodges resort I've ever stayed at. Everything about this place is excellent. We stayed in the cottages which had breathtaking views and were well maintained. The cottages are a bit of a walk from the reception and it's not convenient for elderly people to access. The log huts are a better option.  The food was as always nothing short of brilliant. With the limited resources they have, they always impress me with their delicious food.  We didnt spot many animals during the jeep safari but we were incredibly blessed and lucky to have spotted the TIGER during our boat safari in the morning. Time stood still as we watched the majestic tiger stroll on the banks of the river. What an experience it was! Last but not the least, a special mention",4

Srikanth Madduri,Resort on an island amid backwaters,"This JLR is located on an island in the backwaters of the Bhadra dam. With copious rain in 2019, the dam was near full. This meant vast expanses of water and less chances of sighting animals. The Boat safari and Jeep safari were well organised. Resort staff provide great food and great service. Migration of River Terns in Q1 2020 might be less due to islands being submerged in backwaters.  Overall, a great place for a quick getaway from Bangalore.",4

We stayed in room 16, comfortable, spotlessy clean, air-conditioned with a log cabin-like decor.  The large white bathroom had a breathtaking view, as did the bedroom and verandah. There was room for 2 adults and a child but we took the attached cottage room as we have 2 adult children and they do not allow extra beds. The food was delicious and wholesome with the buffets including both local and continental cuisine. The package included a boat ride when we saw cormorants, osprey, kingfisher, tern, monitor lizard, dear and a TIGER strolling on the banks, rolling on his/her back in the sunshine!

The trek to the cottages are rewarded with spectacular views of the Bhadra river and the dam. Cottages are very well maintained as well. One night package comes with a jungle safari, a boat safari and kayaking. Wild life enthusiasts should consider visiting in summer, as in winter we don't get to spot animals except deer and gaur. However, the greenery and the beauty of river in full flow is best seen in winters, post rains. Special mention to the staff, they are very courteous, helpful and plan the activities seamlessly. A must visit place.",4

Hospitality is good and staff are courteous.  However, we felt, the maintenance of cottages need to improve.  If someone visits this place in summer months, they will be treated with thousands and thousands of river tern  migratory birds who stay and breed in islands which  appear in back waters when water level is low.   Then the jeep safari in to bhadra wild life sanctuary.  Here the forest is  partially evergreen to evergreen.  The forest is superb and a must see for nature lovers.

Most rooms are a bit far (10 minutes walk) from the reception/dining. If you are not willing to walk, ask specifically for the log-huts near the dining. Peak season is the summer when water levels go down and islands are formed in the reservoir where the river-terns roost. The forest is dry too and animal spotting is easier. Off season is after the rains. The reservoir is full and you can enjoy the lush greenery and reservoir views. No other activities are available in the resort.

Saw a herd of elephants with many babies, spotted the pied hornbill as well and have ended the trip with amazing pictures of river terns nesting and the small pratincole with chicks. Unlike other reserve visits, this one was somehow much more serene. The stay was very restful, the service impeccable and the staff knowledgeable. One of the safaris we had the pleasure of having Karthik, the main naturalist of JLR join us, that made the trip that much better. In Karnataka, only JLR for me again.",4
Sumithran,Good stay amidst nature,"It is a Jungle resorts property. There are 2 types of rooms - log huts and cottages. We stayed at the log hut which is closer to the dining area.

The rooms are very comfortable and overlooking the river, The resorts organizes a jungle jeep safari and a boat safari. River terns nest in huge numbers on an island which can be sighted by boat safari. As the nesting season is between Mar-May, you can view the chick hatching and walking toward the water. The resort also offers boating and also swimming in the river, which was quite enjoyable. Service and hospitality is good but food needs improvement.",4

We went in July 2018, and the monsoon season was at its height. Winds blew continuously and there were glorious clouds in the sky.  Not much wildlife sighting, as is to be expected (since the forest has a lot of water).   We were  in a log hut which was very nicely designed.

The cottages are nicely built with modern amenities inside but external facade natural. The resort looks exotic and has cottages in two hills separated by a suspension bridge which itself adds to the charm. Lots of walk up and down will be required within the resort. It could be challenging for elderly people. Excellent food is served in the central dining area. Resort administration could make some arrangements to convey luggages to the adjacent hill where some cottages are located. The highlight of the resort is the jeep and boat  safaris in the jungle. This is a worthwhile resort for nature and jungle lovers.,4

It is accessible through good roads from Bangalore, the view from the cottages is amazing and the property has not become totally commercialized like some of the other popular JLR properties. Which is to say that you still get good service and smiling staff, even if you aren't ""connected"" or lugging a great big camera :-)   For those who are inclined towards water sports, the kayaking etc is great fun as well, which you dont get in any other JLR.  The boat safari is actually excellent and we spotted a Tiger from afar.

Within next 10 minutes our bookings were done.  we went with no great hopes of sighting wild life.  once we landed we were happy with our log hut. after lunch we went for our first safari. On our safari we realised , this place was attracted lot of serious wild life photographers. There were  families too, with younger kids, who were being introduced to nature. I am glad to say all the kids were very well behaved and maintained silence  inside the jungle. The first safari we saw Giant Malabar Squirrel, Sambhar , Barking Deer, Spotted deer and many birds.",4
krupamahesh,Kids loved every second there,"Jungle lodge property location was so good. Jungle and boat safari , bonfire , movie about Bhadra wildlife were all planned by the jungle lodges itself. So it was a very fun stay provided you are a nature lover",4
M S K,Tranquil Place,"This was my second visit to this JLR property after a gap of more than 8 years and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised with the immaculate upkeep of the place and rooms. It is clearly my favourite JLR property. The cottages on the Island offer a spectacular view of the backwaters of the Bhadra Dam.  Even the bathrooms of alternate cottages have only a glass facing the backwaters !  These cottages though, are quite a distance from the dining area and a steep up and down climb. The Island is connected by a steel hanging bridge. Rooms on the mainland are Log huts and smaller than the cottages on the Island. The view from these aren't great either. Price for both these are the same though. Activities include a boat safari (motor boat) on the backwaters and jeep safari (in the",4
Shyam N,A tranquil resort : Nature at its best,"We have been to different JLRs properties  in the last few years. I have no doubt this one of their finest property along with Kabini. We stayed here for 2 days and had an exhilarating and wow experience.The property itself is overlooking  huge water body ( which is backwaters of the Bhadra river) .The view from the all the rooms is really spectacular . It is on periphery of the Bhadra wildlife Reserve. They offer both boat as well as Jeep Safari both morning and evening.  We had a good wild life sighting in the Jeep safari ( done thrice in 2days) and lots of birds in  boat safari. . It's an treat for any wildlife enthusiast and photographer.I too had a first sighting of Tiger in the wild.  Naturalist Kishor was too good in spotting animals, birds and describing various aspects",4
tn_kishore_reddy,A great getaway,"If you like nature with no expectation of animal sightings, this is the place to be in. Water everywhere and great views from the lodge make it a pleasure to laze around in the lodge as much as going around with jungle and water safaris.  Abundant wildlife but extremely difficult to spot due to heavy growth and thick forest.   Resort is amazing in terms of ambience with all the room balconies facing Bhadra river. Food is modest but very tasty and easy on stomach.   Early morning boat safari is good for bird watching. River Terns flock this place between Jan and March. Best time to visit is Dec to March. Monsoons can be good only if you love rain and being indoors.   Jungle safari is great with all the thick forest trees. But sighting animals is tricky in spite of the forest",4
kruthi m,Overall a nice resort and well maintained,"Their activities are quite good , the jeep safari and the boat safari. But in terms of services the Ac did not work and the manager on the next day did not quite give a responsible reply. Food was good and the view from the resort was spectacular, quite and serene.",4
Alvis L,Heaven on Earth,"The best place I have ever visited. I had a wonder experience. It was a wildlife photography trip. I have shared one sample pic. Rest of the pics, review in FB: alvislazarusphotography, Instagram: AlvisLazarus_Photography",4
esveekumar,MUCH DESIRED IMPROVEMENT FINALLY,"Having visited River Tern lodge atleast 4 times earlier, I had witnessed the gradual deterioration of the standard/quality of food etc over couple of years.One was pleasently surprised to see the definitive allround improvement in the place this time.I presume it is the interest taken by the present Manager Mr Pampapathy who was anywhere and everywhere enquiring and interacting with the guests.Well done and keep up the good work because one loves to come back here again and again.",4
Chandra G,Awesome place to take a break from the usual marathon of life,"Loved everything about this place, the room with its awesome view of bhadra backwater, courteous staff and delicious food . Would definitely want to come back and spend may be a weak or so without any hustle and bustle of a city",4
Anasua B,A wonderful vacation,"The two nights that we spent in River Tern Lodge was a wonderful experience.The forest on one side & the Bhadra on the other is a perfect setting for a relaxing vacation.   Nice clean A.C.rooms  ,spacious bathrooms, clean bed linens & towels ,tea & coffee maker in every room.The best feature is the private verandha where you can sit in peace & enjoy the amazing view of the Bhadra reservoir with its tiny islands.There are two types of accomodations, log huts & cottages. For family with kids & elderly persons log huts are a better option as they are near the dining & reception areas.Cottages are quite a distance away & walking back & forth for every meal or outing may not be everyone's cup of tea.The package includes  jeep safari & a boat cruise, both very enjoyable experience.The",4
Suchitra Ravi,Serene beauty,The food and accommodation is excellent. Staff are very helpful. Best part of this place is you will have road and water safari. Both safaris are very different in experience. And one must experience and enjoy both. There are things that need improvement for the boat/jeep safari - 1. Binocular to be made available for jeep safari. 2. Avoid deploying non-JLR staff (like Forest dept) for safari. This happens when JLR is under-staffed. 3. Safety jackets to be made available for all the passengers of the boat; including children.  4. Avoid carrying more people than capacity of the boat. This can be risky.,4
ramshesh,River Tern Lodge - JLR,The place is really beautiful and this is my 3rd visit to river tern lodge. nothing changed.  1) Excellent staff 2) Good Food 3) Beautiful place  4) Amazing view from rooms  5) Excellent service 6) Bhadra tiger reserve forest is beautiful ...,4
YATAGIRI,A quiet holiday,The approach road can be improved.The reception is very pleasant. And they said that they will keep my lunch packed as we arrived late.The  cottages are wonderfully located and if your mobility is not restricted you can opt for a cottage away from dining place.It may take 10-15 minutes of trekking.The rooms are very clean and elegant.The food is good though not lavish.The most heartening thing to notice is the very nice serving.Mr Pampapathi overlooks all the arrangements very nicely.The activities include jeep safari and boating.The jeep safari is a bit strenuous for the elederly and the boat ride is enjoyable.The driver of the boat is well informed and keeps you involved.The surroundings are cool and quiet without TV and can be enjoyed well if one likes the natire. To elevate,4

Smitha P,Family getaway,"It's an excellent place to visit with family if you are looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city,they offer two kinds of accommodations 1)log huts 2) cottages, those who do not prefer to walk around much (elderly people or those with toddlers etc ) can opt for log huts as it is closer to dining area however those who are looking to flex their muscles a bit could go for cottages ..we stayed  in a cottage and absolutely fell in love with the view from the balcony.. they offer two kinds of safaris 1) boat safari 2) jeep safari sightings were pretty good .. however we didn't spot the tiger .. Food here is delicious and made hygienically ..We being vegetarians and health conscious didn't have to compromise on taste.. overall we loved the place and would love to come",4
Ravi U,Badra forest reserve,We stayed there for 3 days & 2 nights - Clean and Good Rooms with basic facilities / Staff were caring and friedly / Food was average - Jeep and Boat safari were good - We were not lucky enough to spot any tiger / Elephant ... If some one who stayed in only metropolitan cities will get excited - Must place to visit for 2 days & 1 Night .... However if some one experienced stay in River side Indian villages might not exite that much,4
Rajeev D,Tranquility at its best,"We opted this getaway since Jungle Lodges and Resorts (JLR) boasted of water sports. On getting there, we were told that Water Sports had been discontinued for long. The JLR website doesn't tell you this. However, our disappointment was short lived. We were welcomed to a beautiful location with an excellent view of the Bhadra dam back waters. One would never dislike this place.  On the food and service, please dont expect much. I have experienced morning coffee and tea served to the room in other JLR properties. Even the management there cannot explain why they cannot serve to the rooms. Food is not great.  Overall, for the price you end up paying, this is certainly not a great place.  Last but not the least, the staff is very courteous.",4
rashrangwala,Paradise for Nature Lovers!!,"One of the best properties of Jungle Lodges & Resorts visited till date!! Best Property in terms of Experience of the Forests, Boat Safaris and Nature!!  The Property Overlooks the Bhadra River and is Serene!! Food ESP CHICKEN is delicious. Staff is Kind and Ever Smiling[ Inspite of carrying our big Bags Up and Down the Hill] . Ensure you mark this place for your next visit if you love Nature and Love the feeling of being Lost in the same!!!",4
Chandrasekhar N,River Tern Lodge @ Bhadra - A backwater paradise,"Beautiful location, lovely environs.  The Safari didn't yield much in terms of animal sightings, just the common herbivores, no spots or stripes which is acceptable, but the Elephant giving us a miss was a little difficult to fathom. Any ways the Tusker did make amends and gave us a glimpse - a distant sighting from our cottage balcony thanks to my son. The place was a little overcrowded, the catering staff were a harried lot trying to cater to the large crowd, they did run out of a couple of dishes as well. Felt the management had kind of overbooked more than they can actually handle. The Cottages across on the opposite hillock are in a better setting, but elders and kids may find the trek up and down to the Golghar for meals and the reception for all activities a bit tiresome.",4
ShareKhan4,Peaceful and visually relaxing,"We stayed at River Tern lodge for 2 nights over a long weekend. Getting there from Bangalore was fairly easy with roads being in generally good shape except a few sections near Tarikere.  We got cottage #21 which was slightly secluded and overlooking the reservoir on two different sides, so we could see the dam as well as the rest of the reservoir.  The staff are very polite, helpful and efficient. Food was good and they had a number of different dishes in the buffet.  We took boat and jungle safaris, and they were fairly interesting and enjoyable. The vegetation in the jungle is quite thick and it can get cool in the early morning.  We saw a lot of birds during the trip, and a few animals in the jungle. Unfortunately no big cats on our safaris though.  The place is definitely",4
Guruprasad K,Nice experience with few shortfalls,The rooms (cottages) were good but far from dining and parking. It is troublesome for elders and no room service. Water sports were cancelled but no substitutes provided. Otherwise a nice place to stay and staff are very cooperative with good food. Had few birds sighting with deers & wild buffaloes.,4
Ritvik,Picturesque and serene,"This place is on the banks of the Bhadra reservoir and at the tip of Bhadra wildlife reserve. Location wise, nobody can beat any Jungle Lodge and Resort property and this is one of their best. The cottages overlook the reservoir. The view of the setting sun from the balcony is beyond words.  The reserve has tigers, leopards, elephants, wild dogs, bisons, variety of deer and even two black panthers. What you get to see is your luck. They have a regular safari and a boat safari.   If you are interested in just peaceful weekend, visit after rains. Water in reservoir is maximum. If you are interested in wild life, visit during summers. Possibility of sighting is more.",4
Nikhila P,Peace and quiet!,"We had a very nice stay at River Tern. The room had a beautiful view of the reservoir, and we were literally on an island by ourselves.The staff were welcoming, sincere and courteous. Lots of wildlife all around. No connectivity and that was a plus for us! Food was excellent. Service was great.",4
JayG,Excellent visit,This was a memorable trip with a family of 10. The food is decent. We stayed in a log-hut and 2 cottages. Cottages are a bit far and aged people will find it challenging. The boating and safari raids are good but we have to be very lucky as with any other such experience.,4
Vaidya R,Excellent place to unwind,"Can't really complain much. Excellent location, with all rooms (cottages/loghuts) overlooking the river. Good safaris with knowledgeable guides(We spotted next to nothing, but that's the way things are at times). Only issue was with some guests who delayed all the jeeps by sauntering in 30 minutes late. But the staff took care of it the next morning, by specifying a waiting cutoff time. Well handled!  One issue was with the food. The lunch and dinner were excellent. But breakfast was too spicy. I can understand garlic in chutney these days, but garlic in sambar was also too much. Probably the first time am seeing this. It is hard to handle so much spice/smell in your food in the morning, especially when you're trying with idli/vadas. I guess will stick to bread/butter next time.",4
subharnab,Good service,"The terrain was a difficult for my mother to walk ... however, everyone found other options and helped out as much as they could. Good service. I have been here before and would love to return again. The property is really good.",4
Kaimal,"Unwind, Relax and Rejuvenate","We had been to River Tern Lodge in Dec-2015 for a 2 nights stay. First and foremost the resort is located admits an amazingly beautiful location. One side you the forest and on the other side vast water body of Bhadra Dam. The resort offers you good stay, jungle safari (by jeep and boat), water sports and reasonably good food. We really enjoyed the two days stay at River Tern. The staff are polite, the safari guides were well informed and helpful in explaining the wildlife. We could see many birds and some animals during the jeep safari as well as the boat safari. We also enjoyed the water sports facilities available there (additional fee to be paid). Overall, a very nice place to unwind, relax and rejuvenate I would say.",4
Trip201507,superb experience,"This place is overall superb and the the view from the room is excellent. I would love to visit again. Though our stay was for just 2 days, our experience was great. Menu needs to be improvised. Butter was fresh but was little stinking.   The staff is very friendly. Connecting to the property was a bumpy ride. You have invested on good mattress but spring mattress is not a recommended one. Hope there will some changes during next visit.",4
vishwasvk,"Stay at River tern Lodge,Sep-2016","The property is situated in a natural setup overlooking the Badhra reservoir.Connectivity to the project is not a comfortable ride.  We stayed at the loghut for 2 nights and the cottage for a night. The proximity of the Loghut to the gholghar, reception, spa and water sports area is very close and a pleasant walk. Room service was good at loghut than the cottage.   The staff at the reception, golghar and the safari crew are good and well behaved.  The Bon-fire was lit on a sunday.. sunday special i beleive :-)  Food: Limited options but homely tasting food, Katla fish fry was the best. Golghar: The plates drop area is next to a couple of dining tables, these tables are not comfortable place to sit for food (people accessing the place often, dropping the plates, washing hands)",4
farhat37,"Awesome location, great experience","The place was overall excellent and we would definitely visit again. First the positives, the location was great, the lodges have a great view of the lake and the forest is thick and enchanting. I hadn't seen clearer skies in a long time in India. We stayed there for 2 days and took 4 safaris (2 jeep, 2 boat), and on every safari we managed to see some new animal or bird. The staff was extremely helpful and responsive and would come running around when asked.   On the negative side, the food options were limited and not so great. Some improvement here would help a lot. The bar was also a bit understocked with the only option being beer or whiskey. The bonfire in the evening was lit in an extremely dangerous way with a guy squirting kerosene on the burning logs. It flared up a",4
I7m7r7a7n,ok ok,"Food - Average, not so good compared to other Jungle Lodges property. Activities - Nothing. water sports are not allowed during rainy season, you will only have safari. Staff - Hospitality was very good & they were very helpful.",4
AbhinavKumar2001,Great location to relax,Location is beautiful. All rooms overlook the reservoir.  Just open the curtains and you can see water and greenery. One can sit in balcony whole day and do nothing.Rooms are well maintained. Food too was very good. However one has to keep expectations low while doing safari. Unlike nagarhole or bandipur wildlife sightings are not good. All in all a great place to relax.,4
Omkar K,Awesome Overall,Room had a great view. You are pampered with tasty veg and non-veg food. Forest Guides are informative. And all staff are courteous. What more could you ask? Sighted my first close view of Ashy Wood Swallows and Large Cormorant nesting,4
Rangan S,River Tern Lodge Bhadra,"This is a beautiful location. Rooms overlook the Bhadra reservoir. One could spend the entire day sitting on the balcony, watching birds and listening to the sound of water - perfect place to unwind Service is friendly, but a notch below other jungle lodges resorts. Morning tea [6 am] is not served in the rooms. No bonfire/barbecue. Wild life viewing is rare - I have been to Bhadra twice and never seen anything other than deer/boars during the jungle safaris :-) .. may be they need to rethink their safari routes.",4

srikant13,Nice resort at a great location,This place is absolutely awesome for a getaway. Staff is excellent and very very helpful.Excellent food as well.    The one thing that you have to remember is that you have to be in reasonably good physical condition to go here because of the terrain of the location. If you book a cottage you should be able to climb 5 flights of stairs about 3 times a day. If you are traveling with senior citizens be absolutely certain to book only the loghut.,4
runningrocks,New Benchmark,"Words cannot describe the feeling, the first time when I entered the room and saw the view from my balcony. The location of this property is impeccable, nothing else mattered for me. Also we went kayaking and its a great location for kayaking. Food and service is good too.

LAKS N,Surprisingly good Karnataka Govt. property,"We stayed recently in River Tern Jungle Lodges for 1 night and found the log cottage to be of good quality, maintenance and layouts. Looking from the Balcony, one can see beautiful misty Dam in the green mountainous background. Drizzle and breeze will make one relish calm confluence with nature. The attention of the staff, especially the restaurant staff are noteworthy. They prepared good lunch and dinner and were kind. With no TV and Wifi, there wont be any disruption to intake the beautiful views. Despite the claim, there was no water sports, but we saw them bluffing to the next guests checking in also. They take us for 75 minutes safari (4.30PM) in to a near-by not so dense jungle where we can see fat trees, some buffaloes, some deers and few birds. If you are extremely",4

The food is simple, South Indian fare and is delicious. Soak in the experience!",4
Gautam M,"Great property, what a view!","If you have been to a JLR property before, this is no different in terms of the rooms, service, very helpful staff, safaris etc. In terms of the location of the property and the view each room offers; it is unique. All rooms overlook the Bhadra and it is simply breathtaking. We went in the middle of the monsoon so it was extremely windy but still worth standing in the balcony and soaking in the scenic beauty.   Food is average+ - simple and down-to-earth - very fresh.   Safaris are great - we went for a Jeep Safari in the evening and the Boat Safari in the morning. Be prepared depending on the season of travel to wear a jacket - also expect to get a bit wet in the boat ride even in non-monsoons (due to splashing of water :) ).",4

Somesh-navya,Second visit and it is still worth more visits,"This was the second time I visited the resort, this time with two other friends and their families. Everything was excellent, but I still think their hospitality is excellent on weekdays when there is less crowd. That is when I prefer to go. The boat safari was not as good as it was two years back around the same time of the year because the water level was much less.  Now that I have been there two time and once with other friends, I feel the best room to stay are room nos. 16, 19 and 22. Do note that all these rooms are pretty far from reception or the dining area and the walk is tiring because it involves climbing down from a hill and climbing up another. But once you reach the rooms, it is all worth it.",4

Rooms are neat and clean, except the forest insects and lizards which are harmless to human (provided you are leery about them!)

You arrive here and you see  all rooms overlooking River which is great. Neat and clean. Staff and Service all good. Food is average, although you will not get much variety. Jeep & Boat Safari is major activity which is 2hours each. You get to see Rivertern birds huge gathering on island along with other animals if luck is good.

The cottage is spacious and provided with all good interiors, attached bath room with Geiger and being maintained cleanly and hygienically. More than two hours jeep safari in national park in the afternoon for wild life and more than two hours boat ride in early morning in the reservoir along the banks for bird watching is awesome and great feeling. The naturalist followed with jeep safari and boat ride gave all information regarding animals and birds. The food arranged for lunch, evening snacks, dinner and morning breakfast is very good and hygienic. Number of veg and non veg dishes",4
Sanjay K,"Great views, dilapidated rooms","Friendly staff, great views, awesome river cruise in the AM... but, that is where it ends. The place is starting to fall apart (some would consider that to be a mystic charm!). The jeep safari is pretty darn pathetic (no animals around) with a really bumpy ride in the jungle. Food selection is decent, though the gol ghar (dining area) is infested with mosquitos (and they do not run any coils or anything to reduce the menace).   Good place for a day trip as a couple or a bunch of nature lovers; not ideal for kids/ families with small kids.",4
Maunang,Amazing experience!!!,"We stayed there day before 26th January for a night.   Cottages (We stayed in room no 21) are so spacious with superb view of back waters. You can sit in Balcony for hours and keep socking the nature. Jungle lodge do not offer modern day entertainment systems (TV/Internet etc), but they offer something great. Experience of staying right near to mother nature. Rooms do have A/C and was very useful in afternoons. Also there is no room service.   However these particular view cottages are very  far from the reception and restaurant (Gol Ghar). About 300mts away and one need to climb up and climb down hill once you cross bridge between main property and island (where cottages are).

All the log-hut and cottage have similar view, and offers sunset view. For cottages choose only after No 18, but then you have to walk a lot too (with kids not a good option).   Staff is very friendly, we got help in shifting our luggage to cottage. Food is good and the timings are strict. For morning safari, Wake up call can be asked for.  Jungle safari was as usual, we saw elephant, gaur, sambar, etc. The driver was knowledgeable and explained a lot about trees and forest.  As a improvement only one thing I would suggest, they should keep some general medicine at the reception, as medicine shop is around 3 kms from resort",4
pranay,In the Backwaters of Bhadra River,"The service at River Tern Lodge is commendable. Punctuality is to the dot, you are give a planed schedule for the stay which includes from the wake-up call to the dinner time. The rooms are beautiful with mesmerising view from the balcony (& the bed as the glass enables you to experience the view staying in the bed). during the sunset you experience the most beautiful view as the redness of the sky is reflected in the backwaters giving the water a dull red glow. There are water sports also at a reasonable price. The accommodation includes boat safari and jungle safari, both these are worth going and there are chances of spotting animals (deer for sure).",4

Since the property is very close to the forest, we found good species of birds sitting in the balcony namely paradise flycatcher, coucal, golden oriol,racket tail drongo etc.The boat and Jeep safari experience are good.The conservationist and driver are more willing to spot animals for you. We could spot a tiger hiding in a bush and variety of animals during our boat safari. The food taste is",4
Sharath_murthy,Amazing experience,"We visited this place on 31 Dec 2015 to 01 Jan 2016, on new year eve. The resort is managed very well. The cottages have the best of the views among any Jungle Lodges and Resorts. They are back water facing and the view is amazing. The staff are extremely friendly. Sine it was a new year eve, they had arranged for a party along water side with music and cake cutting. We had a small baby with us and they catered to all the needs of the baby in terms if proving necessary food, hot milk, water etc.The safari is also conducted well. We spotted a Leopard and other animals. Thoroughly enjoyed the stay. Please continue the same standard.",4
Deepak S,Its all about the view,"This is a great discovery for us personally. The resort is world class with all the facilities needed for a wonderful time!! But the best part is the room overlooking the reservoir!! The bridge, the water sports, the choice in food, the service level of the team, the overall upkeep of the resort is all 5 stars!!",4
Srimathi S,River Tern Lodge,The location of the resort is excellent with natural surroundings with good sign boards to prevent plastic and other waste being thrown here and there . Rooms are good.   Safari fee both for Jungle and water can be kept optional so that people who want to opt shall go else they can enjoy the place without it . NO Telephones and TV is good feature.  Quality of food is average and also more importance to cleanliness and ambience needed at the food court .,4
Shivanand P,Enchanting place in a Tiger Reserve and on the banks of the Bhadra Reservior!,"Outstanding and extremely well maintained property. As all Jungle Lodges, this facility has the hall mark of their personalized customer service! Manager Kartik and his dedicated team lead from the front. They had specially organized an evening with Santa (one of their staff dressed as one) which also included distribution of sweets, cutting of the Christmas cake! This was much appreciated by one and all.",4
Neeraj Sharma,"Not Luxury , but price is luxury","Canteen kind of service, bad approach , un professional staff , Rooms are pathetic. Fit for a day trip only. For the kind of prices charged , Leela and alike hotels sound and feel cheaper. Complete feel of a government run enterprise. more of a struggle than comfort.",4
Aslanroar,Fantastic view,"River Tern Resort is a lovely place for a weekend getaway from Bangalore. Located off Chikmaglur, tucked away among the trees on the banks of the Bhadra Dam, the best thing about the resort is the view from the rooms.  The approach to River Tern is pretty straightforward. We had no issues in the route, and the Maps shows the perfect location. We did get waylaid by some village belles who danced in front of our car, and managed to squeeze some money out of us, but it's all in jest :)  One thing to note is that the cottages are quite far from the reception, and you need to climb around100 steps to reach them, But it's not as daunting as it sounds, the steps aren't too steep and it's quite doable.  We stayed in Log-huts and that's much closer to the restaurant than the cottages.",4
Avian_rao,Mesmerizing stay.....,"Unlike the prescribed best time for visit, we visited this place during August, in the peak of monsoon. As expected, most of the cottages were empty during our 2 night stay at this property. Personally the view that the cottage offers is second to none, during the rains, the water reservoir is just below(inaccessible though) the hut. The surround Bhadra tiger reserve with its range of hills were constantly under the cover of green and mist. To my surprise, the Forest Safari was on.... in such rains not just the jeep safari into Bhadra reserve , but also boat safari. Boat safari needs no permissions is done in house. Staff was extremely helpful and attentive to all our needs. Our hut was the farthest from the Golghar - not only it built appetite, it also offers privacy. Couples",4
AnilBhatta,"Location, location, location","Bhadra backwaters is awesome, pristine and virgin. The forest is a class and the boat safari gives you a glimpse of the magnitude  Loved  - All rooms get a water view - Backwaters - Quietness  - Boat safari in the morning - The forest (not much of wildlife) - Staff - every willing to assist  Could be better - Smelly plates, bowls, spoons - give a hot water wash guys - Safari - Shame that there are no Naturalist to accompany and explain...your driver is your guid  The staff are friendly and ever ready to help - sad that they are just not trained appropriately.",4
Sunil M,Serene experience at Jungle Lodges River Tern,"The room was very clean, the staff is friendly and very helpful, Amenities are nice as well.. Loved the 3 night stay close to nature.. The location is very quiet and if you are looking for a quiet vacation in commune with Nature, this is the place to be. Animal sightings are best in Summer.",4
Shivaprasad,Pristine Forest,River Tern Lodge is in excellent location. Forest and River Safari was awesome. Not much animals for site seeing but had good time in beautiful forest and Badra dam.  Rooms were clean and good food. Nice documentary played on Wild Dog and River Tern bird in the night at Lodge,4
Goldenhead,A beautiful place in the nature,"I just loved it here. I visited this place sometime back but had to write a review. Everything was well-organized here and I loved to be in the middle of nature... beautiful experience going for boating, going to see the elephants in a nearby reserve... would have loved to stay longer.",4
Vivekethiraj,2 nights at River Tern Lodge,"Location and ambience is fantastic. View of the Bhadra dam is breathtaking from every lodge or cottage. Rooms were well maintained and self sufficient. Staff was cordial and helpful whenever needed. Despite families with children being present for the long weekend, noise does not permeate to the distributed rooms.",4
SathishkumarBharathi,Simply Supper...Cottages was very Good and well maintained...Thanks to all the staffs..,Location was very nice. Cottages were supper. Enjoyed all activities. Food was really very nice. Price was Moderate. Water sports were good. But this is extra cost. I request River Tern Lodge to include in the water package in the given price would be really nice for us. Water bike can be at extra cost but all other if it is included it will be nice.  Overall it is Simply super...I recommend to everyone to go any enjoy as a Couple and also family...,4
RamUppaluri,Nice place to take a break.,"This is was our first JLR stay and it was for a night . the entire stay, we felt we are so close to the nature. open forest safari thought we hardly could spot tiger but saw other animals and birds, early morning boat ride and after that water sports, swimming in back waters was really refreshing and we enjoyed it. Staff was very courteous and helpful. Had a great time during the stay,  we look forward to more JLR stay.  Stay was in Cottage: View was amazing as everyone else says.",4
Krishna1982,"Beautiful location, Another great JLR","We stayed at River Tern Lodge for 2 nights during a long weekend in September. The location of this is the best among all JLRs I have visited. It it by the side of the river with beautiful view of the mountains. The rooms were good and well maintained. The food was really good like most JLRs.   The only problem we faced was the location of our cottage itself. The resort has 2 parts and are situated on either side of a bridge. All common activities and food court is on one side and our cottage was at the extreme end on the other side. This meant we had to walk 15 minutes to reach the food court. This was a problem in the night especially with a kid. To be fair to JLR, they offered to shift us by our second night. (Also they mentioned that they are constructing another food court",4
Giri_ferrari,Team Offsite,View is out of the world and one of the best places to visit before you die :)  The food and staff are excellent as it is in all Jungle Lodges Resorts. The Jungle is very dense & spotting animals is a challenge but the Bhadra Dam & Reservoir view will offset it.   One of challenges is that you need to climb a lot of steep steps to & fro......which will be an issue if your travelling with elderly people.....,4
shilpasunderrajan,"Best location, very courteous staff","Went to River tern over the weekend. Just a 1 night stay, which I felt was short. Nonetheless, it was packed, from reaching there before lunch, to a jungle safari post lunch, then camp fire, waking up at 5 45 AM to probably one of the best views on Earth, to the water safari, breakfast, water sports and check out. no dearth of activities here.  The resort: Probably one of the best locations one can get. the resort is spread on 2 hillocks and the balconies face the huge bhadra reservoir. which again is skirted by the beautiful western ghats. so amazing. rooms are very clean, very comfortable beds, huge bathroom that overlooks the waters. there are 2 varieties- cottages and log huts. cottages are farther away from the dining and reception area, so a lot of walking, but a very nice",4
Prakhyath H,Amazing stay for mainly for nature lovers,"Visit to the Bhadra wildlife trip is not complete unless you go to this exceptionally beautiful resort run by the Karnataka Government. This stay gives you a relief from busy & mechanical world. Best place for nature lovers, photography. This cottage has amazing view from its balcony. But u need to at least stay 2 days for enjoying this up to full extent.  This resort is a place packed with activities to keep you occupied the whole time. Morning boat ride, evening safari schedules are very tight and you will hardly get time to enjoy the beatiful view form balcony.  Excellent and very friendly staff. We also enjoyed the safaris...both on the jeep and on boat, starting out with low expectations of wildlife sightings definitely helped :) The boating is pleasent again the sitings",4
anindita177,My experience in Bhadra Reserve,"It was an amazing experience. The hospitality was so good that we will cherish the memories for a long time. The room was excellent, view was amazing from the balcony specially during the sunset.  Service was also very good. Every time we asked for some service the resort people reported within a reasonable time.",4
Prasad Shetty,Amazing cottages on the islands with mind blowing views,"First thing you would notice about the cottage is the mind blowing views from the cottage balcony of the Bhadra back waters coupled with the mountain ranges. You need to atleast stay 2 days to have a relaxed view of this, else you would not get enough time to sit here and relax, your day is filled with tight schedule of safari and other activities. The cottages are bit far from the reception area, an intercom facility would have been worth the price you pay for. Cottages are very clean, well maintained, and well architected with excellent views, Even bathroom has view of Bhadra back waters, what else you want !!  We had an amazing stay, we got cottages 16 & 18, though we wanted double cottage 16,17 as AC in 17 was not working, they shifted to 18.   The cottages are bit far from",4
anujkeshri,A day trip.,Worth a visit. Neatly maintained. Mesmerizing view of Jungle and lake hidden from the world. Yet easily approachable. Visited here just to spend a free day. Good buffet lunch to munch on. Serenity set for a good book read. And appreciate the way this place promote recycling and nature conservation. Will visit again.,4
Kushal B,WOW! It's an amazing place for wlidlife.,"First of all even if it is handled by the government, there's nothing to complain about. All the staff were friendly and they used to co-operate for everything. Talking about accommodation the view was amazing, overlooking the reserve, I've been to Bhadra previously but it's is the first time I visited this resort! As far as service is concerned it's 5/5, the used to change the bedding every day and the food I don't usually eat at home but the food made in the resort was delicious. Amenities there's everything it needs for wildlife and nothing that needs for civilization so it makes tourists to concentrate more on the nature. Frankly speaking I cant stay without looking at my phone but in the particular place the only time i used my phone as while we were checking out till then",4
vinaybv,Very good experience but value for money is missing,"I think I paid a total of 15K for a day. For that, anywhere else I will get excellent accommodation. This was monsoon time and there were no major sightings. All water sports were extra. So I ended up paying mostly for just food and accommodation. Hence price was expensive.   I completely sympathize with the staff, they are courteous, knowledgable naturalists etc., but you cannot have the price of a Kabini at all places.   Jungle lodges is a semi government property and the price does not seem like it. I wish some of the eco tourism is deregularized so that common people can enjoy nature better. Its complete monopoly. Its becoming like the air india of yesteryears. In contrast the GMVNL in Uttarakhand is a shining example of good stuff at reasonable rates.   Excellent",4
NKS66,Excellent Location,"The location of the resort is very good and all rooms are facing the river. Boat and Jeep safari is must and normally included in the package. Water sports activities are available but not upto the expectations.intercom facility is not available , for every requirement you need to walk to the reception area from rooms across the bridge, which is approx 500 m, all staffs are very cooperative and restaurant food was excellent.",4
Chandrashekara S R,"The property, adjacent to Bhadra Reservoir, is perhaps one of the most scenic places in the world.","Rooms are great. But nowadays, even small hotel provide items such as tooth brush, paste, snacks etc in the rooms. No such facilities. You can't even buy. There are no medicines- at least basic medicines.  No news papers. No water in the rooms.",4
Indra Laxminarayan,The Most Scenic Jungle Resorts Property,"With a stunning view of the Bhadra reservoir from each room,  River Tern attracts holiday makers wishing to get away from the stress of the cities. Definitely not a wildlife destination for most visitors - many of them make good use of water sports instead. The new cottages are much better appointed but however are a distance away from Golghar. Food good but repetitive, service very courteous.",4
SRChennai79,"Spectacular views, very well-maintained place, extremely courteous and friendly staff","We stayed in a cottage, which overlooked the river and the forests and we felt like we were the only ones in the place - simply amazing.  The jungle safari and the boat safari were nicely organised and the lush greenery was simply stunning (although it did mean fewer wildlife sightings, we managed to spot many herds of deer, quite a few peacocks and many beautiful birds).  The staff were very knowledgeable about the wildlife and birds.  The food was decent although the choices were limited until the weekend crowd started coming in.  We had two small children and were a bit disappointed with the options for them - everything was too spicy for them.  However the staff did accommodate our request to make some rice a little bit early for them, before the set dinner time.  They were",4
kani75,"Lovely property, stunning views, food could be much better","We are a family of 4, including 2 small boys and visited for 3 days.  The property is gorgeous, very green, excellent views of the Bhadra river and dam.  The room was clean and spacious.  Staff were helpful and kept reminding us of the upcoming activities, which was good.  We managed 2 jeep safaris and a boat safari and had a really good time.  The only disappointment was the quality of the food, which was average - either too oily or spicy or both and the choice of dishes was not too great.  On the other hand, snack time in the evenings was something to look forward to with bondas and bajjis !  All in all, I would definitely recommend River Tern Lodge, both for couples and families.",4
SandyWest,A Scintillating Experience Worth a Repeat Anytime!!!!!!!!!,"Any visit to the Bhadra River Project is not complete unless you go to this exceptionally beautiful resort run by the Karnataka Government establishment called Jungle Resorts and Lodges. Located on nearly the opposite side of the Dam (probably in the Chikmagalore District side of the reservoir) this resort is a place packed with activities to keep you occupied the whole time. Located on one of the large islands  that is connected by a bridge during full levels are the cottages that provide a out-of-the-world experience to those who opt to spend a night or two. Scenery from the cottage balcony of windows is breath taking, particularly in the morning and evening hours. We enjoyed a custom ordered boat ride almost sweeping two thirds of the water body with encounters with the River",4
Arjun R,Fantastic weekend get-away - up close with wildlife and nature,Room was very clean and the view was facing the reservoir. From here you would almost see nature at its best! the food was great with more options than i had anticipated. Ppl are hospitable and the guided safari was very exciting.,4
Dj,Will be best during the Season,"We went in a group last weekend. Booked online and got a small discount. Didn't have much idea about the place other than the explanation in website and the phone at lodge was not reachable. The place is bit interior and is really well maintained. We had a look at both loghut and cottage and cottages are lot better as they are new and more spacious. Only problem is to goto cottage, need to walk for around 200-300 meters (not an easy task as you have to come to the main area for bfast/lunch/dinner and any activity) but it is worth it with a very good view to the river and a walk over the hanging bridge. The staff is really good and they follow the timings mentioned. It was raining sometimes and ofcourse wrong time for a visit to Jungle/Safari as animals rarely came out :( It was",4

Sunilpareek007,Among the best weekend escape from Bangalore,"Great view, great property, great hospitality, great activities....... just awesome!  This property is merely 275km from Bangalore...... a 5 hour easy drive with good NH and SH (max Rs 100 toll) end to end  Pre-monsoon, winters would be a good time  Cottages (esp room 16,17, 18) will offer good view of water  Boat safari can throw pleasant surprises with more sighting than a jeep safari  food ................. just like home....non-greasy and healthy  warm and hospitable staff will greet you every time they bump into you  Cottages are clean, well maintained with large window panes in mid of the jungle/water!  Water sports are bonus   Caution  : water sports beyond one hour can be tiring esp if you have to head back the same day ; walk from dining hall to rooms and other activity",4

jindalbit,Decent Place,"Boat safari is good, got to see the leopards. Good place for Kayaking too. Good options for water sports overall. Food is very average. It was too spicy also. As compared to Kabini River Lodge, room quality is not that good. Also the campus area is smaller and therefore not much space for walk. So overall a good experience, but feels over priced when considering the quality and amenties.",4

It was ordinary but it can't replace the joy, rich experience that comes with this place Place - Kids friendly, Sr. Citizen friendly.  The resort is located on the banks of Bhadra reservoir. To see Rivertern birds and relate to the thousand stories is amazing. This is a wildlife sanctury and you can expect to see a true biodiversity - snakes, birds, animals in plenty.  Overall experience - Super excellent!! Kudos to JLR team especially - Kishor, Harish and Girish (Naturalist, Drivers, JLR care takers).",4
drarunnair,One of the best jungle lodges,"Located on the bhadra reservoir , it's gives quite an unique experience . Since the dam is govt property no other private resort is there anywhere near it's vicinity , so for all aspects this is quite an unique place . Recommend for a 2 day stay  Positives : good food , great staff (like in all jungle lodges ), interesting jeep safari , fantastic views , 2 hour boat ride . Negatives : it's quite a walk for anything and everything , so unless u are fit to walk don't opt for anything across the suspension bridge.  Not recommended for aged couples or very young children due to the amount walking üò® There s no TV and poor phone connectivity ; both suit me so no complaints.  Book and go .  It's a nature lovers paradise .",4
miteshnikita,Fun in Jungle,"This was our first experience of Jungle Lodges & Resorts. Pleasantly surprised seeing such professionalism from a government company.

Spotted several birds, deer, bison. Got lucky & spotted a group of elephants as well. Good trip",4

MarinSoj,Nature and Wild Life at its best!,"This place is blessed with nature's beauty in abundance. The Bhadra river on one side and the forest on the other, makes it so unique and a great experience. It was the breeding season of River terns and my daughter loved seeing the chicks and the numerous birds and wildlife during the boat ride. The safari in the morning was a treat for bird watchers - we could spot a lot of birds, giant squirrel and it was just perfect riding through the wild.   More important, the staff is extremely cordial and more than willing to help and make your stay a memorable one. I specifically want to thank Kiran who was always reassuring right from the booking time and throughout after. Would sure go back again.",4

So finally got the chance to visit this place on my Wedding anniversary. A place that was totally worth all   the wait. This is a place that makes you fall in love with the Nature and appreciate the beauty that our country has to offer.  It was a four hour beautiful journey from Mysore. The Route was excellent, as there was less traffic and serene beauty on  both sides of the highway. The directions   upto the resort is well marked, so we did not find it difficult to reach at all. As we were just 6km to the resort, we were bit surprised to find so many small villages on the route, we were wondering the resort is so near and yet there are so many   villages, cattles roaming, people doing there works, how can the place",4

Vishwas P,This place sloooows things down for good!,"You should visit this place for the wild and secluded nature of this property. We took cottages, which are new and you have to cross a hanging bridge to another island. Which makes it 10min walk every time you want to come to reception, food and other activities. But the for the view you get from those cottages it is completely worth it.  We liked their jeep and boat rides into the jungle and islands. Employees are awesome and they don't hurry. Lot time was spent every time we spotted some wild life. If you want to catch pictures of birds, visit this place in early/late summer and you will run out of battery - but you wont run out of birds (Terns mostly).",4
rakesh d,Very Nice place,The resort is located near Bhadra dam. The location was incredible. Boat safari was out of the world. Jeep safari was also good. We were able to see the river tern birds which can‚Äôt be seen during monsoon season I guess. Overall stay and food was good.,4
randtraveller507,Had a great time!,"Great location, nice, clean cottages, nice view, great food and closeness to nature - what else could we have asked for? The boat safari takes the cake in our stay at the JLR at Bhadra. When the boat stops in the backwaters with wild animals nearby and all one hears is nature's sound: time stops there! It is pure magic! The only point I would like to make is perhaps it is reasonable to charge at least some amount from the Sarkari Babus (Govt. officials) who come here for free - if that is the case, may be possibly we public can be charged a little less.",4

dspguy,River Tern Lodge,The cottages at River Tern Lodge were very nice. The entire staff was polite and courteous -please keep it up. The experience was very refreshing and pleasant. The only suggesion I have for the folks at River Tern Lodge is to give a number to reach at (keep business cards like how other hotels keep) since there are no phones in the cottages -this will solve any communication issues between the lodge staff and the travellers,4

People who cannot walk a lot can opt for the log huts which are near the restaurant and the reception. The cottage rooms a neighboring hillock and is much farther from the reception or the restaurant. If you do not have any issue walking all the way, this is the best option.

Located on small islands of the back water of Lakkavalli Dam this place is beautiful when it has rained. It is lush green around. A boat ride in the river backwaters is enjoyable as they take you to a small island where lots of River Tern birds nest. You can also see many other rare varieties of birds. During the boat ride, you get a beautiful panoramic view of the Western Ghats. If you are lucky you will cite wild animals coming to the river for a drink. During my boat trip in the evening I was able to see a herd of elephants coming to the water for a drink. I also saw herds of deers and wild boars roaming around the place.

Amazing property midst of mountains and adjacent to the Bhadra dam. Every room has a breathtaking view of the backwaters. Good water sport activities for kids.  Evening boat safari is a must. March - May being the typical season for river terns to mate and breed, it was a great moment to see at least 2000 pairs. Apart from this you can just enjoy the landscape and the beauty of God's creation. Bhadra is also a Tiger reserve and me being a wildlife photographer & an enthusiast, was keen to get lucky sighting Stripes or Spots, but in vain.

I booked a ""Loghut"" as I had read before booking that this would be in close proximity to all facilities. I was so glad to have taken the advice, the ""Cottages"" are quiet far away and are accessible only after crossing ""the bridge"" to the other Island.

Do not miss the boat ride - great views and good birding! The Osprey sighting was our highlight! Do the boat ride in the evening and the Jungle safari in the morning. The sunset views from the Boat are awesome!  But then if I have to criticize, I have to comment on a couple of things only:  1.	Price: Very very expensive! The per person pricing just is quite deceptive and the total bill normally is a shocker!

This time we opted to stay in a cottage (instead of a log hut) for the sake of a different experience. They have 10 log huts and 15 cottages - all cottages are on the far end of the resort (on another island) and are accessed via a small hanging bridge. The walk to and from the dining area to the cottages is an enjoyable walk but can be tiring for the elderly. We went for one boat safari and one jeep safari - had a good experience both times. The staff is very friendly and the cottages are extremely well maintained. Net-net, a wonderful experience. I wish they were not as expensive - I would have made more frequent trips :)",4
R_WellTravelled,Fantastic property on the banks of the reservoir !,This is probably the best of all JLR properties in terms of location. All rooms have a stunning view of the reservoir.

Obi Reddy T,"Quite, beautiful place in the lap of nature. A perfect weekend getaway from Bangalore to be with the nature.","I have been to this place in March' 15 with my family. I didn't go there with huge expectations, I just wanted to spend a weekend out of Bangalore in a quite and peaceful place. I chose this place as one of my colleague recommended it. But this place turned out to be an amazing one and beyond my expectations. Its in the backwaters of the Bhadra dam right in the Bhadra Reserve forest. You would see only water and forest around, the only sounds you would hear is the sound of the river, chirping birds, sound of the monkeys & Langoors and its just nature all around you. The view of the River and the forest from the rooms is breathtaking, you can just pass the time sitting in the balcony of the room looking at the river and listening to the sounds of the nature. The food is good, the",4
Kudige,Beautiful Place. In the Lap of nature.,"A beautiful property overlooking the Bhadra Dam and Back Waters. Will be my choice of stay anytime I go back to Bhadra Forest Reserve again. The stay is inclusive of all meals and a choice of two Safari's a day; bang for the buck at that price.   Pros: Location, Comfortable Stay, Basic but Clean and Hot food, Eager to Help Staff, Safari (Jeep / Boat), Choice of water-sports.  Cons: Bugs in the Bathroom (Not a big deal! It's inside a forest after all.), If you are the kind of person that wants an elaborate buffet you might be disappointed.",4
esveekumar,A PLACE WORTH VISITING AGAIN AND AGAIN,"This being my second visit to this paradise on earth, one was quite impressed to see that things are only improving here unlike some places in our country which starts with a bang and then starts deteriorating as fast. Here the acco has further improved and so has the service and catering. The chefs need a spec mention for the variety they produce each day. Having spent three nights and four days one expected to be bored with same food atleast on third day, but it was not to be so. The staff also had service with a smile written all over. O nly was dissappointed to see that the Zip line has not yet come up as was promised during last visit. Overall, an excellent resort to spend minimum two nights. The wild life sighting has become quite rare which is a negative of this resort.",4
PriyaMadhavan,Perfect weekend gateway from Bangalore to be with Nature,"It is about 310Kms from our house in HSR layout Bangalore  to River Tern lodge. We used the NICE road avoided all the traffic and reached the place in 4hr 30mins.  We were awestruck by the view of the river from the room, a huge glass window, almost was like room opened into the river.  The folks at the resort and the naturalist Girish were very courteous and they all wanted us to sight the wild animals.  My husband being an avid Bird photographer got to see many interesting birds including Osprey during the boat ride.  We sighted a leopard. It was at it's playful best..  sky was absolutely clear, stars almost looked like the milky way shots you see in Cosmos.  Food is existential, no fancy spread. we enjoyed the freshly  made rotis.  we would visit soon with our kids.   Btw,",4
Sunshine,Excellent view from the cottage & log house,Stayed with my family for 2 nights between 10-12 Feb in cottage #15 & log house #5.  Excellent view from the cottage & log house.  Avoid cottages if you travel with kids or elderly persons.  Both boat & jungle safaris are wonderful.  But there was no barbeque arranged. Dinner was not satisfactory.,4
Madanlal M,Wonderful stay with nature,"This place cannot be better. I stayed with my family and my parents for two nights, in the cottages in the other island (you need to walk down stairs, cross a bridge, and walk up some more). Beautiful views (even from the bathroom - ask for a room with one), very calm surroundings. Great food and great service (they promptly brought hot RO water for bathing our toddler whenever we asked). Just treat them with respect and they will provide an awesome service.   The price might look a bit steep (Rs5000/person/day) but consider that you have great food (the cook will listen to what you want and honor your wishes) and snacks all day. The price also includes a boat safari and a jeep safari. The views are worth more than the price.   Lots of ants (and mosquitos if you are not",4
najmasanai,good getaway for adventure,"First a word of caution: This place is not for people who are not very fit. One needs to walk up and down 200 steps each way every time to get to the cottages to/from reception/dining area/water activities, plus a 50-60 mtrs uphill winding walk. The log huts are slightly better for those not in good form. Also for those having insectophobia- beware of lizards/creepy crawlies in rooms. Having said that, the lodge's location is exceptional- the views are breathtaking from each cottage/log hut, the walk over the bridge leading to the island which has all the cottages is quite quaint and romantic.  Food and service is excellent, water sports were a lot of fun and safari was interesting though we didn't spot any of the predators.",4

mamta_goyal,great location and service but its not friendly for senior citizens,"I stayed at this resort on the night of Dec 31, 2014 along with my family and had a wonderful time.  The resort is sorrounded by Bhadra reservoir around three sides and hence all rooms (loghuts and cottages) are facing water body. All the rooms are priced same though cottages are much bigger as compared to loghuts. Though we had booked two cottages, we changed one to a loghut for reasons explained below.  Positives: 1. great location, great rooms 2. Jeap safari and boat safari drivers have keen eyes and try hard to spot wild life 3. Staff is friendly and service is good 4, very rustic nature setting (some may find it like not well managed :-)) 5, magic show on the occasion of new year was good but was mostly in Kannada so for non-kannadigas, it got little boring after some time",4
Shiv S,Peaceful stay & amazing wildlife,We went there just after New Year's day to beat the rush and were pleasantly surprised to see the resort fully booked. We stayed there for 1 night and our stay was quite & peaceful except for few interference by the lizards. The jeep safari gave us a good feel of the denseness of the forest - not much sighting. But we were in for a surprise next day during the boat safari where we had a tiger sighting by the riverside. Awesome! A special mention to Mr. Girish who was very helpful & understanding in accommodating us in the jeep safari in spite of a full house.  Areas of improvement; 1. Need rectification of approach road. currently in pathetic condition 2. Managing lizards in the rooms could save the jitters for some families,4
oldeshoes,Serenity,"Ideally one should stay for two days enjoying the idle day time watching the vast waterbody. The Lake, the boat ride and the jeep rides are things one will not forget easily. Things that can be improved: 1. Approach roads and direction to Bhadra are inadequate. This makes the drive, literally the only way one can get to Bhadra, frustrating.  2. The night sky is brilliant with very little ambient light, especially from the hanging bridge. The new lights glaring at eyes kill it 3.The jeep rides are unimaginative.  4. The dining space and the buffet spread are not ample to meet the number of guests.  Be assured of the people who take care of you. Very trustworthy support team. The drivers of jeep and boat are not only polite and also are very knowledgeable.   I would go there many",4

ramesh_b4,Pristine surrounding and environment,"I visited River Tern lodge for the 2nd time and would rate my first trip being better than the 2nd one. If your trip is primarily for wildlife sighting, I would recommend Kabini Jungle Lodge over this place as chances of sightings are higher and is also run more professionally. Food was ordinary. We traveled as 2 families totaling 8 persons (3 rooms). While booking, I had mentioned that I wanted Jeep safari on both days. However, the person allocating jeeps for the morning safari (for the 6 I had requested) perhaps wanted to be the most sought of person and said that it was not possible as they were running a full house. Finally after sometime he said he could accommodate 3 of us for the jeep safari. However, to our surprise, the next morning, we found jeeps had ample space and",4
abinashjee,Good Time at a Great Location,We stayed for 2 nights @ the River Tern Lodge last month. The location is fantastic overlooking the Bhadra reservoir and the property is spread across 2 islands connected by a bridge. The rooms  could do with better maintenance as they seem a bit run down but they are clean and functional. The staff is courteous but can get better with some more professional training especially the F&B and Housekeeping ones . Cleanliness in the Golghar should be the prime focus area as the leftover food in the used plates section attracts a lot of cats. That area should be ideally segregated from the eating area so that the tables sitting next to it can be spared the unholy mess. Similarly the rest rooms in the public areas at the reception/next to Golghar need frequent and rapid intense,4
Siri M,Nice hospitality,"We checked in for two nights, the location is amazing and so are the people but if you are determined to do everything that they offer (the safari and the boating)both the nights then there is no point in choosing a room with breathtaking view!. The safari was nice (if you have been on others then you should pray for a tiger) sans any special viewings. The boat ride was to enjoy the beauty of the bhadra, you do get to see one or two migratory birds though, however, they say Jan and Feb are better times. Do not book rooms on island if you have kids, elders or if you are not a trekking enthusiast yourself!. The rooms overlook The waters and the ones on the island do offer privacy at the cost of of time! The water sports too are closer to the cottages near the dining area and it is",4

From the word go they were very courteous, helpful, professional. We loved every bit of our stay with regard to the Cottage, Food, Jeep & Boat Safari, Water Games, Every single person (front office, House keeping, Room service, people working in the kitchen, the drivers) who worked there was outstanding for their service. They ensured that we got the best experience. A must go destination. Fantastic job done by the team at jungle lodges. Highly recommend anyone to visit this place and stay there.",4
N Kumar,Unique Location,"We stayed there for 1 night which was not enough.

But don't expect too much or else you might be disappointed.

The food's really fresh and is not fancy, it's very homely, so dont forget to gobble up the ghee with everything that you eat there.  It beats me how this is a government run enterprise as the staff is extremely polite and helpful.  Don't miss the water safari for the stunning views that it offers.

We travelled from Bangalore by the car few weeks back. The road is really nice if you take the Mangalore-Bangalore highway till chikmagalur. After that there are 2 different routes towards the property. The last 15kms towards the property is really painful. There are two types of rooms there one is a cottage and the other one is a log hut. The cost of both of them is same. Try and book the cottage for the better view.  The property is really beautiful but what takes the cake is the view from each and every room.

The entire property has been built with utmost thought for the environment.Only the roofs of the cottages are (barely)visible from outside the resort as it is set in thick tree cover. You can never tire of the view. And you are surrounded by the sounds of silence and nature! The cottage is large and very comfortable. The staff are all extremely polite, helpful and welcoming. The food, as at all JLR resorts, is plentiful and wholesome. And the visit to the jungle, a short ten minute ride away, is the icing on the cake.",4

The property is reasonably isolated. View from any room is serene and breathtaking. You are right in the reservoir and post-monsoon the reservoir is full. Pictures can't do justice to how you feel when you reach there. Not a huge spread for buffet but definitely adequate and tasty. Not much oil and spicy. Staff are very friendly. You get a boat and a jeep safari for a night's stay. Well trained naturalist and drivers accompany the guests. Their wildlife spotting skills are excellent. Boat safari in the reservoir is very calm and scenery is just beaauutifull. The water sports facilities are decent and kids would love it. There,4

The image that stays with me is the view from the room - backwaters of the dam, hills and forests in the distance, the mist rolling in and out, and the ""sound"" of water below our cottage.  If you want a eco-friendly escape from the hustle and bustle of modern life - River Tern is a good destination. The rooms are not plush, but are very clean, functional and built to give you the best views.   We stayed on the adjacent island - it is a short walk and a bit of a climb away, but thoroughly worth it. While we were at the resort, it was occupied to its capacity, and that meant that the lunch area could get quite noisy (specially if the guests have kids!).

The property has cottages and huts, where the cottages are located on an island thats connected to the main resort through a bridge. We took the boat safari the first day where the guide showed us the different exotic birds around the property. The next day was the Jungle safari ride through the jungle. Since it was raining we knew that it was unlikely that we would see a lot of big animals. However, we did manage to see the majestic 1.2 tonne Gaur and several herds of deer. The guide who came along with us explained us about the flora and the fauna in this area which was indeed very helpful.  All meals are strictly South Indian. There is a bar which serves beer",4

Depending on weather condition and luck You would see different wildlife. Driver was guide. Came back and had exellent tea and sun set view from balcony. 7:30pm movie show at goal ghar and bone fire. 9:00pm Dinner was served.

GMurali,Wonderful getaway for a long extended weekend,"Whatever you are - a nature lover; busy body wanting to chill out; this place has it all across seasons - though summer is the best time to spot animals in herds.  Staff and friendly and hospitable with a strong service mentality; food is home made style with frequent servings (though fixed timings. Having ala-carte, beverages and snacks on demand would cover up for those who crave to put on extra calories and burn them by indulging in long walks within or just outside the resort ;). There is a reasonably stocked bar as well.  If you wonder that no TVs can be painful, boring - think again. The schedule is packed from morning 6am to 10pm. Of course sighting wild animals can be a challenge during monsoon with enough water holes within the forest. This makes it interesting to do",4

Missing of Kayak (only one Kayak was available), No Row boat, no two seater Kayaks and no surfing boats were available.",4

HEMUAHA,SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL,very nice experience mainly we get a positive vibe and since its safe too it was my first experience and looking forward to visit all the properties drive to bhadra was also plesent even though i was travelling from Maharashtra Pune .,4
kn_sudhir,Nice place,"Approach to resort is scenic. Views from cottages and loghuts are amazing. If you stay in a cottage its a bit on the far end of the resort, so it could take a bit of climbing/walking to reach reception/food area. Service staff is very courteous and helpful. Food is decent. If you are looking for wild life spotting, I suggest to travel in summers. My trip was in rainy season, so never had any sightings of animals on both Boat and Jeep safaris.",4
ashwingarla,AWESOME EXPERIENCE,I am one of the member in a group of todays 35. This is a very nice place to chill out. The river view is really awesome. Couldnt see any animals as it was raining.  Food is good. Good time with water sports. Value for money.,4
sdarshan15,Probably the best Jungle Lodges property,"Great place for taking a weekend break. You have mountains, water sports and the jungle safari, what else do you need? Food is good. The views from the cottages and Loghuts are simply amazing, overlooking the dam backwaters and the Chickamagalur mountain ranges. the staff is wonderful and courteous. I go there every year for the last 5 years!",4
Gaurav M,Nice Place for a break!!!,The resort was just the right place for a much needed break. Its on the bank of huge reservoir and at the edge of dense jungle...We booked a cottage and all the money spent was for sure worth it. The staff was very courteous and helpful. Food might be a problem for a north indian foodie like me...Chances of sighting any fauna in safari are very low...,4
Harjeet Khokher,An awesome experience!,"This was the first time we went out to any of the Jungle Lodges properties. I had heard a lot about the flagship Kabini resort but not much about this one at Bhadra. Frankly, I was not sure if this would turn out to be that great. But boy was I wrong.  The drive to River Tern was amazing with excellent markings and drirections towards River Tern Resort. We had absolutely no difficulty in finding the the place. It is situated on a small hill overlooking the HUGE and SWELLING Bhadra reservoir which looks great. All the cottages are beautifully made with enough privacy from the adjacent cottages that comes with a thick growth of trees all around. Every cottage comes with a great view of the reservoir and one can spend hours sitting in the balcony admiring the beauty of the place.",4
Somesh-navya,The best of scenery and wildlife,"Another fantastic place and another fantastic Jungle Lodge. In terms of scenic beauty, this one's the best of Jungle Lodges and certainly one of the top resorts in Karnataka.  It's on the Bhadra reservoir and just 270kms from Bangalore. It's value for money at 11k per night for a very spacious and comfortable cottage with fantastic panoramic views and all meals and activities included.  Great landscaping, good food, courteous staff, the choice of boat and jeep safaris, the excellent wildlife spotting and much more just add up to make the trip one of the best you've had. We spotted two Leopards, a sloth bear, thousands of river terns, a herd of 20 elephants, hundreds of deer, a monitor lizard, Malabar pie hornbills, and many other exotic birds. After the safari, sitting in the",4
ChitraRao,Awesome place,We were four families and stayed at this resort for two nights in June'14. There were plenty of kids in our group and all of us were wowed by the scenic beauty all around us. The jungle safari on jeep was spectacular and all the accompanying wild life officers were really sweet and knowledgeable. The water sports and the swimming which is offered in the back waters is also absolutely amazing. The food was superb. Huge huge variety and absolutely yummy food. Even the most picky eaters would be able to find something that appeals to their palate ! The staff were efficient and courteous.The rooms are  lovely and clean. The view of the Bhadra from the rooms was to die for !! Overall a lovely experience. Would recommend very highly......,4
SudhaPonnalagar,Just amazed by Nature - Badra Reserve,"We stayed just for a day in Rivertern , Badra reserve in Dec 2013 . We were completely wow'd by nature and its beauty. The property is right on top of the river . The view is just great. The boating and the jungle safari which a part of the package is super. My son who is 7 years completely got lost in nature. The folks out there were too courteous and helped us a lot. The water games was also very enjoyable . The food was OK . But considering the fact that we are in mid of a reserve and it takes so much effort to bring the resources, I appreciate the efforts of the folks there.  One important point to note - We were travelling along the west coast for 10 days by car and we depend heavily on google maps . Unfortunately , this is the only place , where the google maps was",4
Asheeshdh,Great Experience,This is a very scenic place indeed. The view from the rooms is excellent and you might be tempted just to gaze out for eternitity. The food was very homely and tasty. The variety was a bit limited but everything there was was good. The trip can get a bit hectic if you are reaching here after a long drive since you have 2 safaris to do (jeep/boat). I suggest you should stay here a couple of days to truly relax and enjoy. The Staff is very proactive and curteous. Also watch out for the stars at night.,4
Arvind606,Food and service levels are very poor . . .,Food quality has completely degraded. Managementstills runs it like a government guest house and professionalism should improve. The staff is very courteous though. The AC was not working in my room and I was told that the only existing cooler was already provided to a different room.,4
Dilip K,"Our Trip to the River Tern Lodge , Badra Reserve","We visited River Tern Lodge during 29th and 31st May 2014 and it was one of our most memorable trips ever - The resort , during summer is set amongst a beautiful reservoir , Dam and rolling hills and valleys.   The Highlight of our trip was a sudden sighting of the Royal Bengal Tiger at close quarters during the Jeep Safari - this was a very first for us!   We were accompanied by Mr. Karthik , Chief Naturalist at JLR who patiently explained all nuances of flora and fauna in the region. The staff at River Tern were courteous and very helpful throughout the stay, A few suggestions - the most beautiful cottages are in the second island , go for them if you are OK to walk quite a bit , if you have older people with you then choose cottages or log huts near to Gol Ghar. Keep a Torch",4

The guys loved the ambience among the wild & the water (amazing to start & end your day with a drink!), the ladies loved it for the food & the spacious, clean rooms, cordial & always willing to help staff. The kids - well they loved everything, the water games, the food. In all aspects this was a wonderful trip - I am definitely going back there!",4
84robertantony,Fantastic experience,"The high point of our stay in this lovely resort was the nesting season of the Terns. If you are able to plan your trip around the nesting time, that will make the experience absoltuely worth it  The food was good, though a little late sometimes. The staff are courteous and enthusiastic. THe only negative is that the lights by the stone path do not work at night and after dinner to walk back to the cottages over the winding path with only 2 -3 of 10 lights working is dangerous. Especially when children and elders are walking.   Overall, I would recommend this trip whole heartedly.",4
Chintansh,Our Favourite Holiday Destination,Its an awesome place for nature lovers. The location is superb. Total Quite & Peace. Food at the lodge is fantastic and great staff. Just the perfect holiday to get away from the daily grind.  Bhadra forest is one of the most beautiful forests.,4
srimysore,Wonderful Experience,"It was a fantastic 2D 1N trip to River Tern Lodge. The staff are extremely courteous and have the never-say-no attitude (hard to find at most resorts!). The location is beautiful too, and the fact that it was river tern breeding season made the trip much more memorable.",4
MadhuGulur,A wonderful trip to River Tern Lodge,"The time spent at River Tern Lodge although was just a one day package trip, was wonderful.

SandeepMohan,Peace and Quiet,"Wanted to head out with my wife for the weekend. Some place close so the drive is not too long. Jungle Lodges has always been on my radar but never managed to visit any of the properties. One of the problems on some of their properties are accessibility. The property in Kabini has a terrible approach road that is not suitable for a low slung car. As much as I would love to go to Kabini, this really ruins it. After a little research and speaking to a colleague, we narrowed down on River Tern. I was a little hesitant when I looked at the cost for a night. I did forget this after reaching the property though. One annoying part was, I had requested for a particular cottage over the phone. I was told to mention this in the comments section of the reservation which I did. On reaching",4
Santosh K,Great stay,"We stayed here with family for two nights, It was wonderful , amazing experience. If you want to relax and stare at the back waters , then this is the place for you.  @ night and early morning you can hear the sound of the waves, which was so soothing. Food was good as well. All in all great experience and no complaints.",4
Rajiv Jayanth,Great place to unwind,"This was my second visit to Bhadra River Tern Lodge. It's a great property, with scenic views of the Bhadra reservoir.  Pros:  - Location of the property is excellent. - Rooms are clean, and the staff is generally courteous. - Food is excellent. - Jungle safari, boat safari, and water activities are very good.  Cons:  - Cottages located on the island are very far from the dining area, and other activities. - Staff refuses room service even for families with small kids. - Heat is unbearable during summer months. - Desserts are disappointing.",4
sarangmr,Excellent Vacation,"I was looking at various options for a 3 day vacation and hit upon this. The River Tern Lodge is a very scenic and excellent resort offered by Jungle Lodges. The view of Bhadra backwaters from the room was excellent and the room was clean and spacious. I chose a cottage which is on a second island accessible from the main area through a bridge. Since we stayed long, we went on boat safari on morning and evening and jeep safari on morning and evening. The experience was great. The rides were pleasant and we had some good sightings. We watched the River Terns closely during the boat safari and during the jeep safari we spotted Gaur, Elephant, wild boar and wild dogs (We were told by the naturalist in our jeep that wild dogs were not spotted for the past 2 years) and some leopard",4

TDV15,Excellent place to be with nature,"River Tern Lodges in back waters of Bhadra reservoir blend together nature and a convenient tourist place. With absolutely courteous staff and good food, it is sure to be a pleasant stay. Get to see wonderful scenery from every loghut/cottage. Don't miss the boat safari and a beautiful booklet on Bhadra tiger reserve. An educational movie before dinner adds additional flavor to your stay. Kids will enjoy much. In summer, one gets to see hundreds of migratory Terns - pleasure watching them. Boat safari has a brief stop at the island for a close view of terns and 'little terns'. For dense greenery try July-October. It was a (often elsewhere too) disappointment to have not sighted the tiger though! Please take back plastic waste with you!! Excellent place to visit for 2 nights.",4

This is one place where you find a very cozy huts and cottages to stay, nice cuisine to feast upon, some good choice of beverages to quench your thirst, helpful bunch of staff to lead you to safaris, boat rides and water sports.   I'm  frequent visitor to this place, have taken many friends and families, and not even a guy till date has felt that the choice was wrong.  It's one such unique place where you see 1000s of River terns on Islands in the season, Ospreys, Fish eagles, Mammals and if lucky the king cats of the jungle too.  A place to visit and",4
ajitshastri,Blissful time with nature!,The location of the property and the rooms makes you feel you are on sea shore and in the middle of a jungle at the same time. Trees all around and the waters of Bhadra dam hitting the shore gives a soothing experience.   As always- very very courteous and smiling and friendly staff @ JLR made our stay very comfortable!,4

Vignesh B,"""Courteus to the Core""","JLR's River Tern Lodge is one of the finest properties i have ever visited. The Location is unbeatable and the view from the room is breathtaking. I Stayed there for 2 nights With My wife and 3yr old son. Earlier Stayed at JLR's other properties in Bandipur, Kabini and K.Gudi. But River tern Lodge is the Best among them. As Mentioned by others, Wildlife sighting is very less compared to other tiger reserves(If only tiger and leopard is wildlife for you). Being a Wildlife Photography enthusiast, i found Bhadra to be more rich in fauna than any other reserves and national parks i had visited in the past. When i stepped out of my cottage for morning safari, i was pleasantly surprised to find an Indian Pitta at my door step. Apart from Normal Birds like jungle fowl and woodpeckers",4
RiteshB27,Great view and experience,"JLR River Tern lodge is very enjoyable getaway into the folds of nature - overlooking bhadra reservoir, and with jungle safari by jeep and boat. The hanging bridge is cool. Food was also very good esp. lunch and breakfast - I found the dinner to be more oily and spicy, though. There is no room service.  The price at over 5000/person per night is a bit steep - maybe there can be discounting for 2 nights stay or 3 nights stay...",4

Tannishtha,Average one,"Few facts:  A. Its 100 km away from Chikmanglur, hence do not assusme to first reach Chikmanglur and then look for the resort as its two different route altogether from Bangalore  B. The good cottages are about 400m away in an island (connected by a hanging bridge) from the reception, activity and food area. And NO internal transport facility available for to and from movement. Hence, Specify your room location while booking of you have children or elderly people accompanying you.   C. There are no swimming pool  D. There are some over priced water activity in insanely unhygienic, untreated lake water.  E. They mention about campfire etc in their package. Reality: Nothing like that exists  F. No recreational activity or outdoor/indoor game/emcee etc is available. Hence kids had",4
esveekumar,JLR'S JEWEL,"River Tern Lodge of JLR I feel is the best property of Karnataka tourism because of its beautiful location and the most well planned log huts/ cottages. If one really wants to be  with nature and unwind then this is the place. Having stayed in three other properties of JLR during last six months, one has to say ""hats off"" to JLR. Their food was by far the best amongst all their other properties. The Chef Mr Ravi deserves special mention. I wish JLR positions good Chefs at their other resorts too.Over all an excellent stay.",4
Trinetra7,A nice experience,"We travelled from Mysore via Pandavapura, Chennarayapatna, Arasikere, Kadur, Birur, Tharikere and Lakkavalli in our own car with self driving. It was a nice drive except for a short distance of about 16 km from Tharikere to Lakkavalli  where the road is not so good and rather bad in short stretches. After Lakkavalli, clear sign boards were there and locating was easy. The location of the Jungle Lodge is excellent with back waters, jungle and serene unpolluted atmosphere. There are two hillocks (adjacent to the back waters of Bhadra Dam), on which rooms are located. One hillock is an island during mansoon due to full water in the dam. It is connected with the another hillock by a hanging bridge which is very beautiful.  There were two types of rooms - cottages and log huts.We had",4

almighty_traveller,A stay in the woods,"River tern lodge is not a resort, it is an experience. It is a place, every nature lover would enjoy. Its pricey, but the property seems to be worth the money. Jeep safari, Boat safari, some adventure water sports like kayaking, banana ride etc make it a fun filled vacation. Ideal for a weekend getaway.",4
Jeevees,Excellent getaway,"The view from the balcony is great. One could sit there the whole day and do nothing. It overlooks the backwaters of the Bhadra dam. The food quality is good and there is no room service available so one has to walk a distance ( and build an appetite) for food. The boat ride takes you close to the nests of the birds and is a very good opportunity to sight several varieties of birds. Sighting a predator during the jungle safari is rare. If you are looking to relax watching the reservoir and birds, this is the place to go.",4
Jagadeesh R,Excellent resort,Stayed in this resort for a day. View from the resort is awesome as it is right next to river/dam. Couldn't spot many animals during safari due to rainy season. There is a hanging bridge that connects to some of the river tern cottages on neighbouring island. Early morning boat ride is pretty good and expect to see different species of birds. Venture out during night time at your own risk (I spotted one snake when I was walking back to room from bridge). This is a must visit place and ideal for 2 night stay. Met wildlife photographer Sunil Sachi during checkout. He mentioned that summer is the best to visit as river tern birds can be seen during that time. Will definitely visit again.,4
Prashanth A,Safety concerns in the Safari,"Like most of the reviews here, we liked the location and view from the cottages. My review is related with the safety aspects of the jeep safari.  The Safari started at 6:30AM. We were a total of 8 including the driver and 3 children and no guide/naturalist. We spotted peacocks, deer and wild boars during the ride. After about 40 minutes into the 2-hour safari, and about 15 kms inside the jungle, the jeep stopped when we saw Gaurs crossing our path. The gaurs were about 30 meters in front of us and the driver turned off the engine, so as to not disturb the gaurs. After they crossed the way, he tried to start the jeep, but it wouldn't start. The driver and the men in the jeep got off the vehicle and began to push, hoping to do a push-start. No luck either. We asked the driver for",4

Even though 24 hrs water and electricity were promised, sometimes you need to call staff and inform when there were power or water crisis. Cottages are far from golghar. It will be difficult for elders to climb steps. Rooms are full with mosquito, lizards and ants. When we took JLR towel, it had 8 to 10 ants in it, be careful while using.  Staff: Staffs were good and supportive.  Food: Food was OK. Golghar is full of mosquitoes.  Safari: Not much, spotted deer, gaur, sambar deer, barking deer, owl and peacock.  Water sports: Most of the equipment‚Äôs are not working, only few are in good conditions.",4
Akarsh,"Excellent location, very good service, slightly pricey...","Me and my wife visited this place during end Sept '13. To reach this place, one needs to take a deviation to the left, from the highway, nearly 35 km before Shivamogga town. This is located right adjacent / next to the Bhadra dam. There were 2 types of accommodation in the resort - the loghuts built mostly of wood & near the restaurant and then the cottages which were built recently & housed on an island connected from the main resort by a hanging bridge. Windows of all rooms had a view of the river. The river looks more like sea. On reaching there, we came to know that out of 24 rooms available, ours was the only booking and we were the only guests on the 1st day. It was a very good and weird feeling at the same time.

Riven tern certainly lived up all of this and more. The cottages were located on islands of the Lakvalli dam back waters.. rather, the island was about 200 meters from the dam (or so it seemed). Excellent location!! The walk from the reception to the cottage was a bit of a trek.. with a bridge to cross that takes you to the island. The cottage had this awesome panoramic view from the bathroom.. a very pleasant surprise, as we were not aware of that.

There are multiple cottages, most of with a great view of the lake from the balcony, spread out across the property. While not a luxury experience, it's not budget either, at ~5k/night/ person (including all meals + boat safari + water sports). The food is great (wholesome with a ""home made"" flavour) and the staff are very courteous and helpful (other attributes common to JLR properties). There's a boat safari where you'll end up spotting several birds (including the river tern, which lends its name to the resort) and deer for sure - everything else is up to chance :) Also ended up having a great time fooling around in the water along the shore,",4
Balachandra B,Well manged wilderness,"A trip to the jungle lodges run by JLR has always been thrilling and satisfying, and this one was no exception. This was my second time at River Tern. Earlier one was a few years back when the water level was high, the islands smaller and the River Tern population seemed higher. This one was in peak summer, still had all the thrills. The jungle lodge staff are one of the most courteous and knowledgeable in the industry. Food is very delicious as always.Though we had got booking for two different, separated places, the staff was nice to put us in adjacent log huts. Unlike other JLR places, there are A/Cs here, which makes it very pleasant in hot summer. First evening we did the safari and could sight many gaurs, deers, stags, monitors lizards, wild boars, peacock, jungle fowls",4

We stayed there for 2 nights and the River Tern team never failed to stick on to the time table mentioned in the brochure which was handed over to us during check in and all the safaris and activities were conducted in a very good manner and we were quite impressed by their promptness. Views from the huts were amazing and Bhadravati reservoir was brimming with water even in mid April. Though we didn't spot big cats like tiger or leopard it was altogether a new experience for us. In short highly recommended though slightly on the pricier side.We took a bus",4

Quiet a surprise this was. Drove from Bangalore to River Tern and must say it was a pleasurable trip, nice roads and clear sign boards all through.  We reached this place by noon as the package starts from 12 until 11am next day. Wish they include a welcome drink in the package, shouldn't cost much for what they charge. The food was ok ok but their chai and pakoda are really good.  This is a nice secluded place that would make it an ideal place for family as well as couples.

We found the place clean, well-maintained, hospitable, we had taken about 14 rooms, spread close to the dining area and some in the island area (about a 15 min trek) from the reception, but worth every walk, except on the knees :)  The room was cleaned every day, food was organic, both the non-veg as well as the veg selection were lip-smacking, they were extremely accommodative.

anirmukerji,Only a seven star rating will do justice to this holiday place,"This is the most outstanding of all the Jungle Lodge holiday resorts. The Lodge adjoins the lake which was created for a dam , so it is an artificial lake. The rooms are pretty nice. The staff is very nice and friendly. The jungle safari is also pretty good but don't expect to see much. Well the drawbacks - the food like in all jungle lodges gets boring after a while . I don't remember room service as the rooms are very far away from the central kitchen. But despite these drawbacks you will have an unforgettable experience",4

The rooms on the `island' where I stayed were large and very comfortable, with beautiful views of the lake. Its a bit of a hike to the dining area as one has to go down and then up a few flights of stairs, so may be difficult on elderly people.   The food was `ok'. Not particularly good but not particularly bad either. The fish at lunch the day we arrived was quite good. The service is very good - people are very friendly and helpful - something you forget when you live in Bangalore.   Now about the coffee. It is quite shameful that a resort that is in Chikmaglur district, which prides itself to be the coffee city of india serves ONLY bad `Bru' instant coffee. I cannot understand why these places dont",4
aquascapist,Splendid views!,"Ive been to this place twice. Like other reviewers say the view is mind boggling. This place is good to explore for wildlife enthusiasts, nature lovers as well as adventure junkies. You have loads of activities on board. We went on a jungle safari where we were lucky to spot a leopard. The highlight for us was the boat safari which was one of a kind. The staff is very cordial and disciplined. Food was extremely palatable. On my second visit earlier this month I went kayaking here. Again an extremely satisfying experience. Highly recommended.",4
KaSuBaba,Birds everywhere,"An ideal place to relax, do birding  River terns, ausprey, black eagle, darters and many more  Boats are a bit noisy, safari by road is ok, food is good, but can get on you if you stay for long  The highlight is the water front, the huge expanse of Bhadra river back water, makes the place a treasured jewel",4
PradeepPaliwal,Adventureous & fantastic lake views,"We stayed here for 2D1N and wished we had stayed more. The resort is sprawling and on the banks of the beautiful and serene Bhadra reservoir. Unlike other jungle lodges, this one has air-conditioned rooms. We took rooms in new block, which is on an island, accessed by the bridge from the main resort. The view from the rooms is truly breathtaking and one can spend hours by just sitting in balcony and viewing Bhadra reservoir. There is no room service and no TV. Food is well prepared. The jungle safari was good and took us deep, though we could not sight too many animals. Water sport activities are fun.",4
Nikhil M,View from the room is just awesome,"The best thing about the River tern lodge is its view from the cottage- river and hills beyond that. Seeing this view is very relaxing and therapeutic. Its one of the best cottages I have been to. Apart from that their bathroom is really good- large, clean and you can a have view of the river from there also ;-). Food is okay to nice. Don't expect to see many animals during the safaris. But overall a wonderful place to spend your time amidst the nature and in a lovely cottage with awesome view.",4
Root_to_sky,Nice to see the river surrounded by hillocks in the morning,"We visited this place in October and the Jungle safari was banned at that time.The forest is the dry one and do not expect like inside the Rain forest. The view from the cottage was excellent.When we opened our eyes in the morning, we saw the river with birds fyling over and the hillocks at the back  in 180 degree angle which is something extraordinary.I am rating good only for this view.Food was excellent.Enjoy the water sports in the morning which we could not make it because we stayed there only for a day.We came from chikmagalur and reached Rivertern in the evening and we were about to start early to check out the next day.We enjoyed the complimentary boat ride in the morning.First, be sure about reaching the place on time because there were list of activities which you",4
Bathia_Ashish,Just no words to say WOW..............,This is a must visit place for all Mumbaities especially bcoz we so used to pollution noise and this place so quiet . Morning is with chirping of Birds wow ..... You wake up to see the river view right from your bed again a WOW (Big one this time ) also Bathe with this View WOW & WOW . We went here and were lucky  to meet the ED of this place it was nice talking to him and knowing how the developed this place from just a mere jungle . Although the lavish facilities of a five star hotel are not there but we didnt have time to think abt it we were just mesmerized by the beauty . Highest Likes of River Tern on my facebook Place. Water sport is must do specially if u have a kid and it quite resonable .. Food simple but Good taste Manager good Staff Excellent . Walking is lot so,4
Binu P,Nature's Basket!,"In much need of a break from life, a very good drive after, we arrived into this dense forest area. For a change, the world seemed different. It was  a journey from a place with thick cover of buildings, vehicles, smoke and blaring horns to a comfortable blanket of trees, birds, water and monkeys all around. Stunning views of the river from the rooms in the mornings are a real treat to the eye and senses. The Boat Safari for wildlife is rich in bird sightings. The Jeep Safari for wildlife was spectacular. At the least one wonders how all those trees were planted as if in a line and also how they continue to exist and how at all they exist. Staring Bisons, Running-away Monitor Lizards and the for-once beautiful-looking spiders... made all the more better by a great orchestra of",4

Well maintained close to nature cottages with breathtaking views. Excellent and forthcoming staff. As the jungle safari is banned by the government, they provide boat safari two times in the package, once in the evening and once in the morning. I would suggest that take the boat safari in the evening and devote your complete morning time to the water sports that they have available. Kayaking is awesome and so are the other fun sports. These are all complementary.   All in all a great experience, the only downside I would say is the food, slightly though.

yathrikal,An accidental but excellent find,We were looking to break our drive between hampi to coorg when we chanced upon on some pics of this property and we were hooked by the pics. Service was good...they were trhe only ones to  call in the morning of our checkin with the staff enquiring about our whereabouts and reconfirming the booking in our trip. The rooms were truly huge and the view breath taking. You really felt one with nature while standing in the balcony and looking out at the expanse of water with the forest in the background. The food was simple but good.the boat safari was also good.  the rooms with the best view are in the islands but it does involve a long long trek( 200m) to the dining room/reception area which are also the congregation points for safari.  A lovely romantic destination ... would love,4
jewgips,Perfect,We were here as a family of three. The service of the staff and the hospitality simply blew us over. The food was simple but great. The room had a wonderful river view and was so peaceful. The rooms and toilets were impeccably clean. We would definitely go back. We were lucky to have gone on the safaris-boat and jeep. The court just placed an order about prohibiting safaris in all tiger reserves.  The safaris were simply breathtaking with the sun setting just as we were exiting. This was a perfect holiday.,4
Aytas,Excellent getaway from Bangalore!,"We spent 2 nights at this lovely resort, which is about 5 hours' drive from Bangalore. It's located on the Bhadra dam and is surrounded by thick forests on one side and water on the other. The cottages/ huts are spread over two small islands connected by a wooden foot-bridge - it is recommended that you stay on the island closer to the reception/ gol ghar (dining area/ bar). The resident naturalist took us along for two wildlife safaris - one on land and the other on a boat. We sighted a lot of deer, wild boars, wild dogs and birds (including the river tern and the cormorant). We did not sight any tigers or leopards and felt that the naturalist/ guide did not have sufficient local knowledge to track these. We also had the good fortune to sight a tusker bathing along the dam - it",4
arigho57,"Great location, comfortable stay","Like all other JLR properties, this place is located extremely well, perched on a mountainside overlooking the Bhadra Reservoir. The food is good (fried Katla fish caught fresh from the reservoir worth mentioning), but I can never understand why JLR cannot serve some good South India filter coffee! The staff were friendly, the naturalist was good too. We went in end-June, just after the rains started - so it wasn't the best time, but we did see the River Tern island exploding with the juvenile River Tern population, Malabar Pied Hornbills in flight, a Crested Serpent Eagle and a couple of Malabar Giant Squirrels. We didn't the water activities - the idea didn't fit in quite well with a return to nature!",4
nams2012,a great weekend getaway,"I swear to God the rating is for the location and location alone and nothing other than that. Hmm.. lovely lodges, the backwater of the river, the mesmerizing tranquility and wilderness and not to mention the relaxing long drive from bangalore. The major drawbacks are the quality of food and the water sport.. Though the breakfast and the bar are pretty good saviours :) The bird watching trip was average because there were not many exotic birds at the time we visited and the jungle trip was a disaster. Great for a weekend getaway for a couple who want to celebrate a special occasion alone away from the city.",4
WanderingSoul,I shall visit again!!,"What do you need? Do you want to connect with nature? Do you want to take your family to a wonderful place? Do you want to enjoy a beautiful break away from the city rush? Do you want to ride through the jungles and a beautiful river connecting with mother nature? Then, this is the place for you! We went there in a big gang, parents and few youngsters. My father loves nature and the serenity it bring with it. We wanted to take our parents to a place which does not have any mad rush.  Upon a friend's recommendation, we did our bookings at River Tern Lodge, Bhadra. We reached there and it was just bliss. In the middle of no where, there is this beautiful lodge with kind hosts. We dumped our bags and got ready for the Jungle Safari. They took us through the Bhadra Forest Reserve",4
Achyuta Rao,Worst Food ever tasted,River Tern Resort is an amazing place to spend couple of days away from the city life. The JLR location is absolutely mesmerizing. Staff as in all JLRs are cordial and extremely helpful.The highlight for us was the Jungle safari which was organised 2 times - one in the evening and one in the early morning. Both the trips to the jungles were awesome and we enjoyed watching a rich variety of flora and fauna. We also went for a boat ride to the river tern islands and the islands where small pratincole birds nested. It was an experience of a lifetime where we got to see around 10 thousand birds of the same type flocking the islands. Overall experience was amazing ! But the food over there is a huge disappointment. Ordinary hotels in Bangalore do a great job when it comes to the,4
IamAbhishekK,Adventures,"A beautiful place for nature lovers. This Jungle resort is on two small Islands connected with a country style wooden bridge. This place is hard to find on GPS, but difficult to leave once you reach there. My rating is 4/5, few things which you need to keep in mind are: 1. Location- Never Trust Google coordinates for this location. Manually identify Bhadravati Dam location on Map and find direction to wards it. 2. For those who are travelling from Bangalore have two options 1. via Chitradurg 2. via Tiptur First option offers you NH for 70% of the route other is state highway but u save one hour with option2  3. Food is good and bar has limited options.",4
asheeshjoshi,Beautiful Cottages with excellent view,"I am glad I chose JLR River Tern for my 2 day getaway.  It is one of the better JLR properties ( though not as spacious as Kabini ). All loghuts and cottages have amazing view of the Bhadhra Reservoir from their balcony.  And the best part, the loghuts and cottages are A/C ( something that I really missed at Kabini ).  This property also offers two safari options per day ( morning and evening ) jeep and boat. The Bhadhra Tiger Reserve is a dense forest and the jeep safari's are exciting. Though sitings of predators is rare as usual. I think this resort experience is more apt for Bird watching than mammals. The resort also offers options of water sports ( at nominal additional cost ) like pedal boats, cannoning, water rides.  The service and hospitality at the resort is very nice",4
Huzefa,Commercialization sets in - but still fabulous,"Having been to River-Tern twice, 3yrs apart, I did see that the Resort had morphed quite a bit, but the forrest, lake, skies, still hold their head high at being untouched.  The resort has a lot more villas (from 10 ->25 now), obviously nicer amenities in the newer villas (better baths, A/Cs for hot weather). Perched on a hill, above the dam-filled Bhadra lake, all the Villas have a good view of the lake, but with more lights on the resort the planetarium like star-gazing has been affected.   If you are a couple, stay in the older huts, bigger families take the newer cottages on the adjacent island. Couples with small kids, stay at the older huts, since the new ones are quite a walk from the reception and lunch gol-ghar.  The 3 best things to do here:",4

The older ones are close to where the reception and the restaurant; I stayied in one of the newer ones, on the other side. The accommodation itself was not exceptional - the furniture is very basic, and so is the quality of bed-linen or towels, etc.; but the room is spatious and healthy, and what really makes the place exceptional are the large balconies, from which there is a fabulous view over the lake.   The place offers activities, in particular jeep-safari and boat-safari. The jeep-safari can be disappointing (the one I did was definitely so, we hardly saw any animals at all, let alone any of the interesting wildlife), but the boat-safari on the lake is",4

The staff were very friendly, the food was very good, the rooms were excellent!! All cottages face the river, it was simply superb!,sitting in the balcony under the moonlight, listening to the water splash the shore, sipping a drink, worth a million dollars!!!! We dint have luck spotting wild animals in the boat safari, however the jeep safari was worth it all!! We spotted a TIGER!!!! Yes!!!!! We couldn't believe our eyes!!! It was truly a lifetime experience. We have visited 3 jungle lodges, but this one was really worth the visit! Thumbs-up for this one!",4
Suchi G,"Beautiful location, nice rooms","River Tern Lodge is beautifully located on the banks of the Bhadra river. Nature-lovers will be delighted, and I am told this is one of Jungle Lodge's best properties.  The property: The cottages are spread across two parts--one set is near the reception, the other set are on an island. To get to the cottages on the other island means walking over a narrow manmade bridge, there are also steps to negotiate. The dining hall is near the reception, so if you have a cottage on the island, you will need to factor in a bit of a hike. Getting luggage to the second set of cottages is not a problem because the staff will do it for you, but to save them the strain, I'd advise packing lightly in bags that can be carried on people's backs (suitcases with trolleys are hard for them to carry).",4

I was particularly impressed with the driving skills of the jeep safari driver. The staff is warm and helpful, very professional.Dont expect exotic mulit cusine food.. Food is tasty and good though.  The knowledge of animals and birds of the staff is too good. I have a hobby of taking pictures of birds and it was thoroughly satisfying.

And a pig that wandered away from its village into the game sanctuary is not really a ‚Äòwild boar‚Äô.

Do not expect much during the Safari atleast during monsoons... We saw some Bisons, Deer, Monitor Lizard. We saw a Serpent Crested Eagle, some Hornbills too...

But when you increase prices, you should also know that your property will be compared with the ones that come in the new price range. With my recent experience at River Tern Lodge, I think that they have not thought about, or prepared for, typical expectations at their new price point.  River Tern Lodge is located on two islands in the Bhadra reservoir. Location is amazing. Cottages are spread out nicely around the islands, each one with adequate privacy.

We're pleasantly surprised with the location, pollution free place. Each of the cottages are facing the river, big size & well organized. I believe that's the trade mark of Jungle Lodges resorts!  Professional staff and yummy food! Be prepared to add few Kg to your weight with the non-stop (well, almost!) and complimentary food served at River Tern Lodge!

It would help to start early so you escape the traffic.  The place is nice but usually booked to capacity so rather than taking a chance book in advance to save yourself the trouble.  One thing that we ignored was the fact that the resort is spread across two hillocks and one has to cross the river to reach the new wing (where we got the rooms).

Sunset view is very nice from the balconies. Don't take room no. 1 to 4 of the log huts as the view is better in the other cottages/huts. With kids it is a little difficult.

We had special request to do only wild life safaris instead of some of the other boat rides and stuff which we did not fancy. Staff reluctantly agreed to it (Not sure why they had to be reluctant about it as the JLR office had confirmed that its flexible and we could just do safaris).  All the log huts faces the backwater and has a great view from the room. One could just go there for the view from the room and has a nice portico facing the backwater. One could just sit there and chill out.  Safari is just ordinary. I didn't see the enthusiasm and commitment like the other JLR safaris. We,4

Apoorva,Kerehaklu April 2023,"Kerehaklu is right amidst nature sharing boundaries with Bhadra Forest and this is why it makes all the walking trails so special! The trails feel like you're entering a deep jungle and we saw deers ans peacocks. We also spotted a Bison during our ride and it was enchanting !  The hospitality is excellent, food is wholesome and there are variety of options served for breakfast,lunch and dinner. Rooms are very clean and tidy!  Mr Ajoy was very friendly and accomodating of all our requests and took us for walks and rides in his Jeep and his knowledge on the flora and fauna is quite commendable.  Overall, i thoroughly enjoyed my stay in Kerehaklu and it's a must for everyone who wants to experience nature deeply.",5
Kshounish P,Too good to be true,"Stayed at the Retreat with my wife and extended family. Could not have asked for a better Retreat in the lap of nature.  Absolutely stunning property and great food. Definitely going to go back again. Ajay, the host showed us around with great enthusiasm and passion. The nature trails he has marked out are a delight to explore, especially with binoculars in hand.",5
Jogeshwar Mishra,"Exceptional, and ""one of its kind"" retreat","Although we have been regular consumers of Kerehaklu coffee, we were pleasantly surprised to find its name as one of the most highly rated retreats in Chikmagalur during our research. We were incredibly lucky to book a cabin at short notice. That was effectively the end of our effort in the trip, since Mr. Ajoy Thipaiah, the host, took over then onwards. Starting from planning the trip, with precise instructions and directions, to checking out, Mr. Ajoy personally oversaw every little detail of the stay, including personally guiding a lovely trek.  Kerehaklu is a paradise for any nature enthusiast. Four lovely cottages lie nestled in dense, pristine greenery. The cottages themselves are very comfortable, with a large bathroom, and include all amenities. The dining hall is very",5
Purav B,Essential and Tranquil,"Having been a longtime fan and regular of the coffee produced from their estate, I was delighted to find that Kerehaklu also had an eco resort. Our communication throughout the booking process was comprehensive and succinct. Ajoy made sure we had all the information at our disposal before and through our arrival at the property. The cottages were cozy and well equipped. Ajoy's passion for coffee and Kerehaklu are palpable through his conversation and demeanour. I would give my highest recommendation, this place is a must visit.",5
kumar24,Coffee Enthusiasts,"Kerehaklu is a must stop for any coffee enthusiast. We were served some delicious speciality coffee and taken on a tour of the production unit. We learnt a lot about coffee and the challenges for a grower.  There are multiple trails through the estate which shares a boundary with a forest. Ajoy the estate guardian and owner took us through two trails, showed us  historically significant trees and plants and told us stories about the jackfruit loving elephant and tiger spotting. We were accompanied by Kiwi the lovely estate dog.   Food was great. The cottages are beautifully constructed timber structures with clean  bathrooms. Their is a sit out for each cottage with ample privacy.",5
Ayush Bhargava,Rejuvenated!,"Kerehaklu is a beautiful property and Ajoy was a welcoming host making our stay really enjoyable. He took us around the estate and gave us a lot of insights on coffee. It definitely exceeded our expectations and we didn't want to come back. A perfect detox. To add, the food made by Raju and Bhagya was brilliant and well curated for the two days. Will definitely visit again!",5
Apoorv A,Don't think twice!,"We had attended a brilliant workshop conducted by Pranoy and his father, Ajoy. Suffice to say, it exceeded our expectations. We spent 3 days learning about their plantation, the lives of the locals and just everyday things. Our rooms were clean and cozy, and we had the heartiest home cooked food.   It was a work trip turned serendipitous vacation. Would definitely be coming back soon!",5
The Fat Labrador Caf√©,Crop to Cup,"Very insightful workshop and awesome stay at the Kerehaklu estate! Highly recommended! The workshop spanned three days covering coffee plantation tours, coffee picking, processing, roasting and finally cupping",5
Mayuk Rebello,Experiential stay at Kerehaklu,"Eight of us (all involved in the coffee industry) attended a 3 day coffee workshop at Kerehaklu hosted by Mr.Ajoy and Pranoy Thipaiah, owners of Kerehaklu Estate. We occupied all 4 cabins at their homestay for 3 days and 2 nights.  Apart from the workshop itself, we found the cabin to be beautifully rustic, spacious enough, very tidy and comfortable. You can see that the wood used to make the cabin originates from within the estate. Mr. Thipaiah has also used Coffee wood stumps very creatively. The cabins are tucked into the Estate but bordering the forest boundary, opening up the best of both worlds.  Coming to the food, the dining area is located very close by to the cabins and we were well looked after by Raju and Bhagya (Hope I haven't mixed up the names) cooking up some",5
Komal C,I spent the most peaceful and comfy birthday at Kerehakalu,"Waking up in this farm that‚Äôs surrounded by so many trees was just blissful. The food and the staff are the loveliest people. But my highlight of the trip was the farm tour where I hugged a massive 400 yr old tree. Thanks for being so kind and having built this wonderful place Ajoy. And your dog kiwi is the cutest thing ever!    The place is comfortably reachable by road. 4 of us drove down to it and stayed for 2 days where all our meals were sorted. So all we had to do was sit and have a peaceful time and not worry about any amenities. Everytime we went into the dining area, we‚Äôd be excited to see what was served. It was a surprise everytime and the taste always reminded me of home. I‚Äôm really greatful for this place and the people who run it.",5
Madhvi B,Basics done Beautifully !!,"Spent the New Years here and it was absolutely wonderful. The cottages are comfortable and the food was 'home cooked' good. The best part of Kerehaklu is the beautiful surroundings - there are ample walks and pretty spots to discover. The sounds of nature - the rustling wind, the myriad bird calls -  and the smells of nature provide a perfect haven for reflection and connection. Ajoy and Pranoy are excellent hosts and I would highly recommend Ajoy's jeep ride through the estate :)",5
Rohita,Loved the entire experience at Kerehaklu!,"Our stay at Kerehaklu was great - the cottages are clean and well maintained, the food is very homey and nice, and above all this place has a great vibe. The owners are truly welcoming - they took us for a hike that ended with amazing views and a jeep ride of the estate sharing a lot of interesting stories. We also learnt so much about coffee, it was truly amazing to see how things work. Overall, it is a great place to unwind!",5
Julia,Stunning wilderness and warm hospitality at Kerehaklu,"Kerehaklu will always remind me of the play of shadows on a full moon, sitting amidst friends around the fire after a delicious, satisfying dinner.  While our vehicle approached this gorgeous property, my friends and I were struck by the tranquillity the place offered. There is great detailing and care put into the rooms and surroundings, which adds to the allure of the natural setting.   Mr. Ajoy and his son, Pranoy, were indulgent hosts, taking us through the estate on walking trails and jeep rides. Discovering the history of the location, their coffee cultivation process and the different varieties of coffees they produce was fascinating.  Though it was only a short trip, I found myself looking forward to meeting Kivi, their beagle(-hound). He charmed us with his goofy",5
Mansvini,Absolutely wonderful stay,"Went for new year‚Äôs weekend and had a really great time! Have always enjoyed Kerehaklu‚Äôs coffees and enjoyed the stay just as much.   If you like coffee, learning more about the coffee production process and the challenges/journey of being a sustainable producer, recharging beyond the reaches of phone network, trail walking, wilderness, rustic simplicity, fresh air (important for a NCR resident) and excellent home cooked food - look no further.   The owners are so approachable and warm. Particularly, Ajoy Sir was so helpful with providing detailed directions and tips in advance, and both him and Pranoy entertained all our 1001 questions with great patience and candidness.",5

With great weather, amazing walking trails that allow you to discover nature, clean & fresh home-cooked meals, you can't really go wrong!

As coffee lovers, we had a blast learning about the property and processes from the very patient hosts :)   We'll",5
Avantika Jain,Excellent experience,"Right from the booking emails to the stay, it was a wonderful experience at Kere. With Mr. Ajoy sending through an extremely detailed email, including recommendations for breakfast on the drive from Bangalore and the route, it was very easy to get to the estate in about 5.5hrs by road. Upon arrival, we were welcomed with some lemonade, a most adorable Kivi (their beagle/hound), and super cozy cabins. A jeep ride with Mr. Ajoy through the estate in the evening, and a walk the next day with his son Pranoy, helped us understand how much goes into maintaining the ecology and coexisting in an extremely biodiverse coffee estate. Overall, it was an amazing experience, with really good food, nature, and Kivi <3",5
nature_explorer,a perfect example of human co-existence with nature.....enthralling trip,"Set deep into the woods, Kerehaklu is a nature lovers delight. The coffee plantation has been carefully entwined into the forest by the owner Ajoy & his son Pranoy, who go the extra mile to spend time with the guests and make them feel at home and not forgetting KIWI their Beegle who loves company. Be it the hike in the forest or the jeep ride deeper into the jungle with Ajoy or the coffee cupping session with Pranoy or just a lazy morning walk in the thickly wooded surroundings, it was amazing. The cabins are comfortable and well serviced by a team of hospitable staff who serve a variety of local food which was really good inspite of us being vegetarians and not from southern India. Cellphone Network is an issue and not very stable as this is really deep into the woods but it",5
Vikrant1980,Wonderful Plantation Stay,"Kerehaklu plantations is located at the edge of Bhadra National Park, with plenty of walking trails (within plantation), good food, and wonderful hosts - Ajoy and Pranoy - who are always there to help you with anything you might need. It's a great place to just relax, have a digital detox :) and enjoy (self-guided) Plantation walks & bird-watching !! Ajoy has lot of knowledge of local ecology and is passionate about conservation. It's great to talk to him on his efforts, and how he has diversified his plantation for other produce. A highly recommended place indeed !!",5
Antaraa V,Can‚Äôt Wait To Go Back!,"If you‚Äôre looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life, charming Kerehaklu may be just the place for you! A different kind of bustle is all around you at Kerehaklu - from peahens nesting, to coffee being processed, it‚Äôs a wonderful world of its own.  Ajoy and Pranoy were the most gracious hosts. Their passion is infectious and it was a treat listening to their stories about the plantation, the wildlife and the importance of coexistence.  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, they took care to ensure that we were the only guests at the property during our stay. The cabins are very well appointed and the food that Raju and Bhagya prepare is just spectacular!  Being at Kerehaklu felt like a once in a life time experience and we can‚Äôt wait to be back :)",5
Tushad K,Surreal,"We spent a few days at Kerehaklu in the middle of April. One of the reasons I put off writing a review for this long was that no blurb of text seemed to do justice to describing the awesomeness of the place, the people that run it and the creatures that inhabit it. But I'm no artist or musician (though many of Kerehaklu's guests unsurprisingly have been), so this medium will have to do.  Kerehaklu is wonderful and surreal in a way very few places manage to be. It professes to be a coffee plantation on a hill. But it really is an abundant ecosystem that's cared for by Ajoy and Pranay Thipaiah, who tend to the land, its plants and animals with an earnestness that's rare and admirable. The cabins are spacious, comfortable and clean. Because they're built on raised platforms,",5
Isha Maniar,A place time moves slowly and the coffee flows fast,"My stay at Kerehaklu was wonderful in so many ways. The hosts, Ajoy and Pranoy, a father-son duo, were so warm and interesting; the forest so pristine; the staff (Raju and Bhagya) always happy to provide steaming cups of coffee and cook excellent food (make sure to ask for neer dosas).   The drive around with Ajoy and coffee walk with Pranoy were stellar and their commitment to the plantation and the forest is obvious for anyone to see.   Would highly recommend.   P.S.: Kiwi (their sweet puppy) is very, very cute <3",5
Sahil H,Fabulous!,"This beautiful coffee plantation, tucked away in Chikmagalur, is a gem. Ajoy and Pranoy are the most wonderful hosts, warm and welcoming, with the best stories about the forest and about coffee. A special mention here to Kiwi, Pranoy's extremely cute dog, is only right. We most definitely recommend Kerehaklu to anyone looking to immerse themselves in nature and to drink excellent coffee. We also saw a bit of a bison.",5
Anant Prabhu,Offbeat with some great Coffee | Best place for a digital detox in Chikmagalur,"Nestled on a hill about half an hour out of Chikmagalur, Kerehaklu is a tremendously organic ecosystem. While it is a coffee plantation, its surrounding forest, trails, caves and streams constitute an independent natural ecosystem of its own.   There are plenty of bison, drongos and several thousand species of flora and fauna in and around the property. Almost all the trails make a great workout for the city gopher.   Ajoy and Pranoy (a very friendly father and son duo who collectively run the plantation), make the stay very comfortable and enjoyable. They both are some of the nicest people in these parts and really know their stuff when it comes to coffee and the ways of the forest. Several stories emerge if you're lucky to spend an evening with them. Ajoy took us on a jeep",5
_dipty_nanda,Kerehaklu- a nature wonderland,"Me and my husband stayed at Kerehaklu for 3 nights and 2 days and we didn‚Äôt want to come back after that! If you are looking for escaping into nature, this is your place! Great rustic accommodation and delicious food! There are only 4 cottages in this property, so it‚Äôs like you have the whole place to yourself... you are surrounded by fresh air, chirping birds and solitude.. they have great trails within their property to take long walks. Ajoy is a great host and he had so many stories to share on the jeep ride that he took us on.. It was a great stay for us and we forward look to returning back again!",5
Puja Patel,Kerehaklu vacay,It was such a great experience.  Both Ajoy and Pranoy are great hosts. We already miss the food we had there. It was so good. The estate is so beautiful.  They have an option of 5 self guided trails . We would definitely like to visit the place again.,5
Harsha J,Scenic and serene,"Kerehaklu is easily one of the favourite places I've been to in all my years of traveling. It's hard to fault anything really. Ajoy is a very gracious host who ensures everything is perfectly managed on the property.  The rooms are clean and cosy. The food is especially good - home made and authentic, it leaves you happy at the end of each meal. The property is breathtaking. 270+ acres of coffee plantation which feels like a plush forest. We went in the middle of a very hot summer and could take walks at noon without breaking a sweat. The best part is that there are many kms of trails which are marked out and easy for anyone to access. This is one place I can't wait to go back to!",5
Krittika,Great Place to Visit - Highly Reccomend,"I visited Kerehaklu with my family in early 2021 to take a break from the city.   We booked two cottages - they were clean and well-maintained, exactly what we needed after the long drive to Chickmanglur. The cottages provide a brilliant view of the estate. Waking up to the sounds of birds chirping was every bit as incredible as we expected it to be.   The food (and coffee! - but more on that later) was delicious. We were offered hot meals (thanks to Mr Raju and Ms Bhagya) - rice, dal, sabzi, fruits and a dessert were typically on offer. Beverages such as coffee and tea were also available on order.   The best part about Kerehaklu were the treks and tours. The host - Mr Ajoy - provided an informational pamphlet on the treks that visitors could take while staying there, ordered",5
Shikha K,Beautiful experience,"My partner and I did a 3N4D stay at Kerehaklu during my birthday week. It's a beautiful property nestled amidst a coffee estate, and the slightly elevated rooms lend the feel of staying in a tree house. If you're a nature lover, it's the perfect place to be as you wake up to the chirping of birds and beautiful sunshine. It's definitely not a place for people wary of co-habiting with insects like lizards and spiders [we weren't :)], as you're literally living in the middle of a forest. There are trails around that you can explore too.  Ajoy is a very warm and terrific host. We really enjoyed the one-hour open jeep safari, where he drove us through the forest explaining the nitty gritties of the coffee plants and the history of the region. Special mention to Raju and his wife, who",5
C S,"Trip to Kerehaklu, Chikmagalur","We have stayed in many homestays and there's no contest that Kerehaklu is the best!  So what's so special about this place?  Only 4 cottages nestled among coffee plantation, awesome simple freshly cooked food, the hosts give us a lively, lovely,engaging informal tour of the vast estate abutting a forest.  One is free to contemplate,restrospect for oneself.  With a blink of an eye, I will go back to this pristine place.  Many many thanks to Ajoy,Prannoy and Raju  Shaila Chavaly",5
Rony Geo Alex,Amazing stay felt at home away from home.,"We went out to Kerehaklu to spend some time together. The ambiance and experience elevated the romantic experience we had. We had a lot of fun time exploring the estate and plantation. The tranquility of the place, the surrounding birds and the sound of the stream as you walk through the estate is an amazing experience. The food was super tasty and homemade, hence did not feel guilty about stuffing ourselves. I would recommend this place as a getaway for the weekend. Cell reception is poor, but this only helps us connect with each other and spend time with nature.",5
Dhw,For the coffee enthusiast,"A quaint getaway ahead of Chikmagalur.  Go for  - the coffee  - the 400 year old fig tree  - to learn more about coffee!  It was wonderful to see native species co-existing in their natural habitat alongside coffee. Unlike most coffee estates, Kere hasn't cut down the ecosystem to produce only coffee. Came back appreciating farm to table produce a lil more as well. Pranoy and his dad are great hosts, couldn't have been seamless.",5
Riddhi,Totally worth visiting,My friends and I spent two days at kerehaklu and were so glad to have got a booking. The estate is tucked away in the outskirts of Aldur bordering the forest reserve which makes it a great place to break away from the city hustle. Getting there from Bangalore took around 5 hours and was super straightforward thanks to our host Mr. Ajoy‚Äôs directions.¬† Upon reaching the estate we checked into our cabins which were very comfortable and had everything we needed. The cabins themselves are made almost entirely with materials available in and around the estate which makes them very unique.¬† We had all meals included which consisted mostly of yummy home cooked South Indian food. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard of Kerehaklu coffee but you HAVE to try the Kerehaklu masala dosa if you get the,5
Zoozoo_R,Charming stay,"Staying in the cottages at Kerehaklu is an altogether wow experience! Nestled between massive trees, coffee and pepper plantations, listening to unique chirping sounds, leaves hustling around - all in all, very relaxing stay.  Mr Ajoy (the host) is a very interesting conversationalist; well informed and keen on sharing lots of stories about his plantation, life in Kerehaklu and overall Q&A about coffee. He took us on a lovely morning trek, an evening sunset ride & a coffee tour & each of this was a great experience.  The cabins are well furnished and spacious enough for a couple.. There are a total of 4 cabins at this property located beside each other.  The stay here had an all inclusive meal plan. Very homely dishes and very hospitable staff.  Mr Ajoy gives suggestions on",5
Arthy N,A real break from everyday humdrum !,"We spent two nights at Kerehaklu and left yearning for more. There are 4 cottages and we had booked all of it and hence we experienced a near private resort experience. Its nestled in a vast coffee plantation and you will be far away from civilization. The highlight of the estate is Mr. Ajoy ( host & owner). He gave us great company, told us a lot about coffee , answered so many questions patiently and took us on a beautiful trek. The cabins are cosy with all basic amenities. Food is very homely and tasty. Don't go there expecting a lavish spread. There are also some trails that you can do on your own and be with nature during your entire stay. You wake up to the  sound of birds, get your dose of tasty coffee and truly disconnect from your regular routine. Highly recommend",5
citizenkna,Go hang out with a 400 year old tree,"So much more than just a coffee estate. Pranoy and Ajoy are the most incredible hosts - with a depth of knowledge about not just coffee but also the birds, plants, animals and the landscape. My fav part of spending time here are the self guided trails that allow you to wander into the plantation and forest and still find your way back easily - doubled back on the blue trail many times to spend time with the 400 year old strangler fig tree!!  The cabins are cosy and comfy. If you‚Äôre a coffee + nature lover I would urge you to go visit - there‚Äôs just 4 cabins so it‚Äôs limited capacity but hey that‚Äôs a plus when we‚Äôre still in a pandemic - all covid protocols followed by the staff + hosts including temp checks and masks.",5
Sanaya89,"Peaceful, charming and delightfully informative!","We spent 3 memorable days at Kerehaklu. Our accommodation was excellent - cosy wooden cabins, with great attention to detail, surrounded by trees. Our hosts - Ajoy and Pranoy were very hospitable, taking us on hikes and teaching us about all the flora along the way, guests are invited to peek at the coffee harvesting / processing and we found our time there very informative. The food is amazing - hearty breakfasts, local cuisine and they even accommodated  our dietary restrictions very graciously. The COVID safety precautions made us feel very comfortable and safe. It's a haven of bio-diversity with self guided trails, ancient trees and so many birds, frogs and visiting wildlife. Will definitely visit again.",5

Breathtakingly beautiful view of the magnificent hills and the sunset from the Coffee Drying Yard is something that can't be described in words. Tour of the estate on an open Jeep with the owner and host, Mr Ajoy Thipaiah, was definitely one of the main highlights of our stay at Kerehaklu. The hike to Doddagandi Betta, the six trails in the coffee estate, the hospitality, the food, the list goes on... There's nothing that one will not like at Kerehaklu Retreat.

They have 5/6 nature trails, all neatly marked out, which depending on your fitness and time, that you can choose to explore. You can hike up a hill, spend time alongside a stream, spot birds with your binoculars or study the abundant flora in the plantation. They have a jeep ride and a nice session about coffee processing. At night, the bonfire and snacks are a social delight. Best of all, the hosts are tremendously social and attentive!.",5
Prasenan,Chill Getaway,Just 4.5hr drive from concrete Bangalore to the calm serene forest land in the midst of coffee plantations over 240 acres. Great hospitality with home made food which is very contagious. Hats off to the team. The icing on the cake is the coffee tasting by the young budding professional Prannoy ably guided by his experienced hands on father Ajoy with over 4 decades of focussed determination. Great place to be prepared with the right gear for 6 trails for the family to suit each one's sustenance. Would love to return to experience yoga in the early morning serenity.

The cottages were beautiful, the plantation stunning and the hosts were the best. With covid norms followed throughout our stay, we had a lovely time here. The food was homely & so good that I ate more than I usually would. Mr.Ajoy was a gracious host who took us on a wonderful jeep ride and a hike across the plantation.

The food was fantastic local cuisine and delicious - both the vegetarian as well as the meat options. We did - the jeep tour across the estate, the walk tour with our host (5th gen planter) - and it was an excellent nature walk...Pranoy also had a coffee grinding/brewing session in the sleepy afternoons we spent there - and it totally woke us up.

He knows chikmagalur and the history of the area as if you were reading a beat selling book about it. We also ran into some bison while driving through the estate - an unforgettable experience.   The food was excellent and the coffee was outstanding. For NYE, we sat around a bonfire and had a scrumptious barbeque with 7-8 different items on the menu. Couldn't have asked for a more satisfying last supper of 2019.  Thank you Ajoy and Pranoy for a memorable stay, will definitely come back real soon!",5
Rohini Kamath,"Coffee, wilderness with some peace and quiet","We booked our stay after closely following Kerehaklu on instagram. It was evident that these folks loved their coffee and were passionate about the work that they do. Our weekend was perfect, but for one half of the first day, when we had neighbors playing loud music on their phone for hours. Luckily they checked out the very next day and it was back to our relaxing weekend. The food served is delicious, vegan and vegetarian friendly. While at Kerehaklu, take the time to walk around the estate as many times as possible, there are a couple of streams marked out and do make it a point to sit by the streams along the routes to hear the sounds of the jungle. The host is very warm and extremely responsive on email and to messages. You could go back again and again just to soak in",5
Fatema W,Great weekend getaway from Bangalore!,"We brought in the new year at Kerehaklu with a group of friends from Bangalore and absolutely loved our time there! The cabins are clean and very comfortable and the food is amazing (especially loved the bbq spread laid out for us for NYE). Most importantly, the resort is run by a family that truly cares about the environment. Ajoy loves the resort and coffee and it was evident in all our interactions with him. Highlights included tracking a herd of bison and learning more about the process of coffee production. Highly recommend this resort and can‚Äôt wait to go back!",5
Bhavna P,Beautiful escape in the Wilderness!,"We spent the best 2 days in this property learning about the flora and fauna in this wonderland. It was also the best crash course to the art of growing coffee. Ajoy and Pranoy showed us the different experiments they're running with how they grow & dry the coffee beans. A lot of art goes into growing coffee and Ajoy and Pranoy are so passionate about what they do - it shows. You cannot get this experience anywhere else. There so many walking/hiking trails on the property. You'll have maps to explore on your own. The Jeep ride Ajoy takes his guests on is the best part of the trip here. We had real close encounters with bisons! That was the highlight of our trip.   The cabins we stayed in were cozy & clean, & they'd been built using cedar woods that were grown on their own",5
Deepesh A,One of the best hoildays ever.,We were at Kerehaklu from the 1st of November to the 3rd of November. It was one of the best stays ever. Its silent and serene. The food was mindblowingly tasty and Ajoy as a host was extremely warm and friendly. No wifi is the best part of the property because it allowed time for us to spend some actual time with each other. Left the place craving for more. Will definitely go back.,5
charlene s,A perfect getaway from the city,"Kerehaklu was the perfect getaway for the following reasons: - Ajoy the owner is really kind, hospitable and loves the land. - It's easy enough to get to from Chikmagalur city (only 45 min drive) - The property is rustic and the cabins are nestled in harmony with the surrounding trees. - The cabins are aesthetically warm, cozy and very clean. The beds were modest, clean and comfortable. The bathrooms are big and very clean. So important! - You get a little folder about the hiking trails you can go on on your own. Plus ways how to save energy in your own home. I think this is a good effort to educate guests on how to be more conscious about our consumption patterns. It shows that Ajoy really cares about the planet. - The food is homely, local and very tasty. Best sambar I've had.",5
Madhu Satyanarayana,Best homestay/estate experience ever,"I chanced upon Kerehaklu on Instagram, and after learning more about this place online, was intrigued and we decided to spend 3 days here during the Diwali weekend. BEST DECISION EVER!!! We have stayed in many homestays, coffee estates, farms over the years all over Karnataka and hands down, Kerehaklu scores top on all counts.  1. The location of the cottages in the lush forested area, completely unexpected and atypical. Magical.... 2. The food here is enough reason to go back, ignoring all else! Thanks to Raju and Bhagya 3. Mr.Ajoy of course, we had many interesting conversations with him. His knowledge and passion for this lifestyle simply shine through and he is the most gracious host we have met.  4. The many trails to explore and estate drive with Ajoy were refreshing. 5.",5
richakulkarni87,Our favorite weekend getaway from Bengaluru,"We absolutely love, love, love Ajoy's place. This was our second visit. The first was four years ago and the experience stayed with us. The beauty of the estate, the warmth of service, and the treasure that is Ajoy's company and his many, many tales of the flora and fauna of the plantation estate. We took our in-laws this time and they said they'd have liked to stay at least another day. Next time, I'm bringing my parents along. We have been to many resorts and homestays but there is something so comforting about this one that we just want to keep coming back. And also, the food is excellent.",5
Anusha_Subramanian,Kerehaklu - A breath of fresh air!,"If you are looking for a place to spend a relaxing holiday, completely unwind, enjoy lush greenery all around - look no further than Kerehaklu. Nestled in the midst of coffee plantations, the cozy wooden cabins make for a very comfortable vacation spot. The place is completely void of digital distractions - no wifi, no TV and spotty phone connections, which is a great way to just relax and forget about the hustle and daily routine at home.  The rooms are neat, well maintained with clean bathrooms. Weather permitting, the trails around the estate are a must try! The staff are super friendly and take extra care to customize any food requests that you might have. Food is wholesome, well made and with plenty of variety for each meal.   We stayed here for 3 nights and traveled with",5

Nagashree,The most relaxing stay imaginable,"Kerehaklu is a hidden gem tucked away in the wilderness of the western ghats, away from the real world. It provided the perfect getaway for me - it felt like home, except home this time was in the form of a tasteful, rustic cabin in the woods. Bhagya and Raju cooked a feast for us everyday, the food was very homely and utterly delicious. Ajoy and Pranoy are such wonderful and warm hosts, they really make an effort to make you feel at home and go all out to ensure you're comfortable, their hospitality really made my stay all the more special. The misty morning walks and the plantation rides personally accompanied by Ajoy and Pranoy were the highlight for me - so so dreamy. I loved my stay at Kerehaklu and I am definitely going back.",5
rekharedy,"Principled, Righteous and Passionate Owner!","We had booked two rooms in advance. My sister showed interest in joining us hence, we booked third room two days prior to arrival at Kerehaklu. Unfortunately, she cancelled her trip. We could neither use the extra room neither did we discuss about it with the owner, Ajoy Thipaiah. Surprisingly, on the last day Ajoy returned the advance amount of the third room and said his conscious doesn‚Äôt permit him to keep the money! Very rarely do we find such people.   Coming to Kerehaklu, it is a very simple coffee estate of around 280 acres of coffee and pepper plantation, four or five cottages and a small dining hall. What adds life to it is the strong connection which Ajoy Thipaiah shares with the plantation. When Ajoy narrates a huge bison of over a ton jumping upon fence of a meter",5
Joseph Anthony,Tranquility at its best!,"Our family of six enjoyed a wonderful weekend filled with serenity and tranqulity at this amazing nature lodge. We totally enjoyed our stay at Kerehaklu which is far from the madding crowd yet easily accessible thanks to the precise directions provided by the host, Mr. Ajoy Thipaiah. We loved the morning trek to the nearby hillock which was guided by Mr. Thipaiah. Also, the beautiful jeep ride around the estate when Mr. Thipaiah explained to us with utmost passion about the flora and fauna found around the estate. The food is amazing as well. Definitely a place not to be missed.",5
SwanandGanoo,Peaceful jungle stay,"The KH resort, located in a thick jungle like Coffee plantation offers 4 cottages almost next to each other. We stayed in cottage #2. Booking process was smooth. Remote, beautiful, serene, green, and cool in May as well. Plantation tours are led by owner, Ajoy, in his 4WD (detailed explanation of coffee estates rich plant and animal life was valuable). It can be enjoyed best  by foot following 6 colour coded trails wth varying difficulty levels. Food is traditional South Indian Meals with hardly any repetition on the menu. Coffee to die for.  Ajoy is very helpful with sending maps and location services and advising on locations to visit nearby. I would give it 6 stars if I could.Will surely visit again.",5
medakeshav,An experience you wouldnt want to miss,"Kerehaklu is a way of life away from the city. Perched on the borders of the Bhadra forest, it surprises you with breathtaking views of the western ghats just a small trek away from the estate. Its pristine environment is as refreshing, Mr Ajoy the host has grown up here and spending time with him in the walks / tours of the property gives you all the more reason to love the place. His immense knowledge of the life, flora and fauna is left us in awe. Definitely coming back here.",5

The perfect place, to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life. I'm definitely going back again!",5
Nishanthkr,Live in the lap of nature at this Coffee_ Jungle,"A coffee estate bordering the Bhadra tiger reserve. The beauty of this place is the cosy_ authentic coffee estate experience you get unlike a commercial resort. Only 4 rooms , beautifully designed and maintained . Excellent homely food made by Raju. You live in the lap of nature listening to birds . Plenty of peacocks in the property and the view point is fantastic. Try the walk in the trails on your own unaccompanied by anyone ,it‚Äôs a thrilling experience . Stayed in early monsoon _ may last year and we were the only 2 guests, that adds to the thrill. If you are looking for a natural , rustic coffee - Jungle experience this is the place . But if you are looking for a commercial resort with games , pool etc. this is not meant for you",5
Mansi,Surreal experience!,"Spent a wonderful time with friends on New Years Eve at Kerehaklu amidst coffee plantation,truly a surreal experience. Ajoy was an absolute wonderful host, he took us around the plantation in his jeep one evening and a hike the next morning overlooking the valley, explaining us about the coffee plantation and later the coffee drying techniques.  This place is decently priced and rooms are very well maintained and clean, very polite staff and amazing local food to relish. Atleast 2 night stay is a must. Kerehaklu is the most serene place we have been to and we would love to visit here more often.",5

Ajoy and Prannoy were super hosts. Ajoy was an absolute delight to communicate with providing us with precise, clear tips and instructions on how to get there, amenities, and food. Prannoy brought with him a great vibe, making us feel at home and among friends.    We were taken around the plantation by jeep one evening and for an early morning hike that helped orient us to the terrain and surroundings.

joestefankoning,One of a kind experience in India,"I stayed at Kerehaklu for a week in December 2018 with my partner. During our travels through India and Sri Lanka, this was our favourite place by far. The coffee plantation is managed by 5th generation farmers who really love what they do, and are keen to teach you as much as they can. Everyone is very helpful, knowledgeable, and the traditional South Indian food is amazing. Would definitely recommend if you like beautiful scenery, wildlife, coffee, and getting outside. While we were there we spotted hordes of monkeys, porcupines, exotic birds, giant squirrels, bison, and even came across some elephant and tiger footprints. Thank you Pranoy and Ajoy for an amazing experience. I would definitely return to Kerehaklu.",5

Ajoy (the owner of the estate) and his son Pranoy were amazing hosts. They were warm, friendly and very helpful at all times. Our cabin was spotless and our rooms were well catered for. Delicious traditional meals from a local chef were prepared for breakfast lunch and dinner. Coffee that was fresh from the plantation was also served throughout the day.  While the lodgings and amenities were perfect, my favourite aspect of our stay was the experiences and adventures that could happen only at Kerehaklu. Pranoy is a 5th generation farmer at the plantation and had a wealth of knowledge about the wildlife and plant life at the estate. Pranoy taught us about the complex",5

I have seen very few people who share his passion and enthusiasm for agriculture and nature. His knowledge of plantations, birds and animals is truly appreciable. My wife and I, along with our 1.5 year old baby, had initially planned our stay during the last week of August but had to reschedule to November.

An amazing host who shows you around his property and tries to accommodate every (reasonable) need you might have during your stay there. :)  The only thing I found amiss was Airtel's cellular network.

The resort just has 4  rooms which can accommodate 4 family of 2 and 1 or 2 kids. Not sure if Ajoy entertains additional adults in a room so no idea. Ajoy also took us on a trek to nearby peak which is a trail of about 5kms from resort to peak and back. Nice rejuvenating walk early in the morning. Don't miss coffee in this place and blend that Ajoy serves is from his mom.Divine taste for coffee lovers. Taste still dangles in my mouth being an avid coffee lover myself. Overall, great experience staying there. BTW, no mobile",5
Brent W,Fantastic farm and great accomodation,"This is a coffee farm home stay in cabins. The cabins are more than suitable and the location is beautiful, sourrounded by bush, coffee trees and wildlife. There is a great patio with a fire for evening gatherings and the dining area is clean and the food great. The cabins have power and hot water with shower and toilet facilities. This is a great spot which I would most certianly stay again on my next visit.",5
prakritipathania,way to end the year,"This is probably the second review that I have written since I created an account on TripAdvisor (which was some years back) , so that in itself speaks volumes about how great our trip was.   Ajoy by far is the most hospitable host I have ever across and the methodical manner in which he had organised our trip made me ask him twice if he was an ex-army man.   The jeep ride around the estate, an early morning trek followed by barbecue later in the evening were much needed deviations from my everyday routine which mostly has me staring at laptop. ( I do hope my boss doesn't read this)  Kerehaklu is a great way to get a break from the hustle and bustle of city life and admire the beauty of ""Prakriti"" :P. The cottages are comfortable,cosy and well maintained and the food served is",5
Chetan A,Eco Retreat indeed!,"I was here with my wife and my kid for 2 days and we had a great time indeed!  The place is completely covered with greenery.  The coffee trails (5 of them with varying difficulty levels) were a joy to walk, the thick cover of greenery ensures you are always in cool shade.  Also the ""guided tour"" of the place on a open jeep by the Ajoy is quite an experience.   The stay which is actually in a wooden cottage was quite neat - all amenities that you'd expect in a classy stay were there.  If I have to be really nit-picky then would say the bed made a little bit of noise.  The hospitaility was excellent and things were always there even before we could ask for it.  Food was quite sumptuous and the cook was kind to prepare some non-spicy stuff for my kid.  The owner (Ajoy) personally",5
y0gitabhatia,Very rejuvenating and relaxing stay,"We stayed at Kerehaklu in mid December. The cottages are in the midst of a coffee plantation and feel like a jungle lodge. We loved that we had no mobile or internet connectivity during our 4 night stay. That really helped us to unwind , relax and spend quality time together as a family. The evening bonfires were a cherry on the cake. There are 6 trails within the property. We did 4 of them and they were quite exciting and fun for our kids. We were lucky to spot a wild boar on one of the morning treks. The trails are well marked but it takes time to spot the markings. It would be helpful to have a picture of the trail marking available in the cottage, so that we know what to look for. Food was great and the cook was nice enough to cater to some of our diet restrictions. The",5

Soak up your senses in what is called pure tranquility and enjoy nature at its best - among green coffee trails, hundreds of chirping birds and 100% fresh air.   We thoroughly enjoyed our weekend stay in the cutest little log cottages maintained to perfection by the owner and host Mr. Ajoy. He makes your stay all the more memorable because of his warm hospitality. He accompanied us on our walks and took us on an open jeep ride through the estate sharing  interesting insights and episodes related to coffee, and life around it. He is an amazing guy to know!  The food was excellent and we hogged :)  Overall, one of the most",5

Ashok P,Very very relaxed stay.,"The place was very peaceful, clean and serves great food. The host Ajoy was very helpful and nice to talk to. He gave us information and directions to visit nearby places of interest.  I highly recommend this  place to people who want to de-stress, as there is no television or mobile net work. Would recommend to carry a good pair of shoes if one wants to do a lot of walking in the forests and plantations around.",5
Kali K,"Homestay, Estate trails, Amenities","We stayed at the retreat during Dussehra 2016 for 3days. The location is a bit interior approx.16kms from Chikmagalur (8kms from Aldur). The owner Mr. Ajoy is a warm person and a gracious host. He has mailed us the directions (from Bangalore to the property) before hand. We happened to reach Aldur, after dark and we were lucky the estate jeep had some work at Aldur and Mr. Ajoy offered for the jeep to guide us to the estate, thus ensuring we do not get lost.   Coming to the estate we found hot food, clean cottage, warm camp-fire and the entire retreat all to ourselves. The food is good home-style cooking with a lean towards Kannadiga cuisine and flavours.   There are only 4 cottages. The cottages are clean and provided with hot water, towels, clean sheets, a fan, emergency",5
Sushant A,The best place in Chikmagalur!!,"Kerehaklu was a big surprise for us (me & my wife) from the moment we reached there. From lovely and cozy cottages in the middle of the jungle, the wood, the bed, super awesome food and absolute peace. We didn't take much time to fall in love with the place <3.  Mr. Ajoy, the owner of KEREHAKLU cottages and one of the biggest coffee planter in Chikmagalur was super humble and a wonderful person to meet. He took us to long jeep safari on both the days of our stay and told soo many stories about the trees, coffee, animals who visit his coffee farm. No doubt that he is one with nature.    If you are looking for peace, plenty of nature and super awesome home cooked food, Kerehaklu is your answer!!",5
Anvitha S,A Serene Getaway!!,"Myself and my Hubby stayed at Kerehaklu during the Gowri-Ganesha holiday break. Our trip was a really relaxing and rejuvenating one. Staying amidst the Pristine nature was a good break from the hustle bustle of the city. Right from reserving the place to all the formalities, Mr. Ajoy was very efficient and helpful in all means. the place was well maintained and there was no disturbance from any means. The food served during our was simple yet good. I wish they served more of the Malnad cuisine during our stay... Our overall experience was a pleasant one. Thank u Ajoy, will hope to return there sometime soon :)",5

Gogsblore,Serenity amidst the forest racket!,"Weary city dwellers in search of peace & opportunity to rejuvenate, you cannot find a better place. Tucked away from everything, you will not find any man-made structures on this property to hamper your views or any of the treks you embark on. With abundant forest sounds for company, its blissfully serene n peaceful. Fabulous photo ops during the early morning & evening treks. With a wonderful n well informed host in Ajoy, the experience at Kerehakalu is multiplied many times over. Delicious home cooked meals add a special touch. Cottages are well done & spacious with large toilets.  Not very suitable for the elderly as the path to the cottages are inclined & not much flat area for them to walk around in.",5
SiddharthSingh78,"Excellent vacation with zero trouble and 100% fun and, not to miss, perfect host!","Dear Travelers,  First of all, I apologize of being late for this review. I visited this place in mid august and have been travelling since then.  But better late than never. here it goes.  We decided to take a break and visit the glory of Western Ghats in monsoon. Though most of the home-stays we were looking, offered good deal on 2 nights three days, but we wanted to stay two different places to cover more parts of western ghats. ( For my other stay , read the review).  Upon requesting Ajoy (owner), he agreed to give us the stay for one night here. It was the first weekend this resort was opened after monsoon.  When we reached the place, we were truly mesmerized.  the place is so beautifully taken care. each and every thing at the place is so nicely crafted, as if personally",5
mohitsrivastava15,"A warm, caring and cozy sojourn","My wife and I were looking for a break from the city life and Kerehaklu was the perfect get-away. If you wish to experience being in the middle of a forest then this one is for you. Surrounded by dense green cover, are 4 cottages, a dining area with a fire place and also bon-fire arrangements. Apart from being a homey experience, a visit to the coffee estate, a small trek up the nearby hilltop and good food made it a lovely trip.   The best part of the stay was the hospitality of the owner Ajoy. He was kind enough to not only take us for a short trek early morning but also provided us a personal tour of his coffee estate. Also another highlight of the stay was the dining area where not only were we served mouthwatering food, we got a chance to interact with another couple over",5
Swetha S,A perfect weekend getaway,"This is a quaint getaway not too far off from Bangalore. Nestled in the midst of a coffee estate on top of a hill, it gave us the much needed peace and quiet while surrounded by all the sounds of nature.   It was a rainy weekend when we decided to visit and we were unable to go on the treks around the estate. If you are a trekking enthusiast I would suggest you visit during a dry time of the year.   Mr. Ajoy who was our host, was very friendly and helpful. Do ask him for the jeep drive around the estate. The interesting tidbits he shared during the drive kept us engaged.  The staff at the retreat were also friendly and helpful.",5
harshvardhany,One of the best in Chikamagalur,This place held true to the high expectations raised by the Tripadvisor Ratings and reviews. We were a group of 7 and Mr. Ajoy and his staff took amazing care of us during our stay.  Amidst a huge estate which practically translates to living in the jungle it was the perfect getaway. The stay was very comfortable with very tastefully done interiors. And the food was really delicious. The evening bonfire only added to the magic.  A whole lot of treks to venture on around in the estate which Mr. Ajoy has very nicely marked for our convenience. He took us to one such trek to the nearest peak for an amazing view of the entire area.  We were really grateful to them for such a wonderful time.,5
SRRMurthy,a family outing,"all the members of my family decided to have a break away from the sweltering hot summer in Bangalore. We selected Kerehaklu for our outing since were told it is one of the best maintained resorts in chikmagalur district. kerehaklu resort is a fantastic place to stay in the midst of forest like coffee estate extending to approx. 275 acres. the cottage built using 90% of wood gives a real feeling of staying in a forest. everything about the cottage is artistic & done with taste and excellent planning,  Tasty malnad food added to our comfort, we enjoyed the variety at breakfast, lunch, dinner & the best coffee served with utmost courtesy & hospitality. The staff is well trained to look after the visitors & their comforts. Hats off to Mr. Ajoy for all his efforts. We thank Mr Ajoy",5
miteshnikita,Cool place with Warm hospitality!,"Found this gem through trip advisor reviews. Booked with ease. Had a nice peaceful time with family. The living cottages are part of a large coffee estate. The estate is very beautiful with lovely coffee plants, varied type of large & small trees, a bamboo garden, peacocks, birds etc. The estate borders an actual forest and several animals (elephants, bison etc.) regularly come inside the estate (usually at night & away from the living cottages). Ajoy, the owner of the property, was very hospitable. Ajoy took out time to personally greet us in to the property, show the cottage, took us to a jeep tour of his estate as well as for a refreshing morning trek.  Great local food and very courteous & helpful staff. Not much activity for very small children though. But my little one",5
Gautham_Nanjunda,The place to stay in Chikmagalur,"Me and my wife stayed in Kerehaklu couple of weeks ago for 2 days and loved every moment we spent there. Woke up to the sounds of peacocks, wood peckers, koyals with a cup of amazing coffee grown in the same estate.  Took long morning walks along one of the many trails in the property. Had a guided Jeep ride by Ajoy who is the owner & manager of the property. Socialised with the other guests around a bonfire. Ate the amazing food served with care. Visited places around chikkamagalur. You may find a lot of these things in other places, but what makes Kerehaklu different is the personal touch that Ajoy gives to the whole experience.   11 out of 10 for Kerehaklu.. You folks are awesome. :)",5
AnuGummaraju,Simply the best...,"Magical Kere Haklu. Far from the madding crowd. Lush green coffee estates, woods, state forests, only the sounds of nature for company. A terrific host, Ajoy. And great staff. Home cooked, amazing local food.  Hard to describe Kere Haklu without throwing in multiple adjectives. We were looking for a place to completely unwind and yet do active stuff. This is it.  Need a super-knowledgeable guide? Ajoy was gracious to take us on a trek and a ride through the woods and the forest. Explore on your own? Well marked trails, coded by distance and difficulty level allowed us to do a lot of exploring on our pace and time.  Ajoy is also such a great host. The long conversations over dinner every evening were one of the best parts of this holiday. The personal attentiveness just made all",5
Rachit,Perfect getaway...,"If you are looking to get away from the city and need a break, there can't be a better place than this.. beautiful drive from Aldur, its located in midst of a vast coffee estate, peaceful and serene.. The wooden cottages are quaint.. If you are the type, then you can listen to the jungle sounds for hours sitting in the cottage porch.. There are many trails marked within the estate for simple walks to more steeper treks.. There is an open bonfire place where we spent nice evenings chatting with other guests.. The host/owner (Mr. Ajoy) is very gracious and very involved with the guests of the retreat, he is there if you need his help for treks.. the food is good too.. One of the best part of the stay was the tour around the estate in his jeep, we even spotted a male peacock which",5
djadon,Tranquility Exemplified,"My search for a short holiday amidst greenery in the heat of April in the Chickmagalur hills ended at Karehaklu. Mr. Ajoy was quick to reply all my e-mails throughout the booking process. Karehaklu offered us the right mix of a homely stay and privacy. Loved the fresh home cooked meals, welcoming host, Ajoy and the company of other friendly guests. We stayed at the last cottage down the hill and felt as though we were in the middle of a forest. The sight of hundreds of fireflies in the night and the sounds of insects was magical. Though there were frequent power cuts, the power backups were seamless. The various colour-coded trails inside the coffee plantation were fun and challenging enough for our boys. Host Ajay was friendly and attentive and our family had fun on the hikes",5
Bharat T,Perfect place for a 2 day getaway !!,"The only sounds you hear are the ""jungle sounds"".City folk tend to 'tune out'several jarring sounds of traffic honking etc.Here you first need to get used to the brilliant silence--but then on ""tuning in"" find a multitude of forest sounds --a soothing symphony !! Waking up to bird calls is a special bonus very few of us are used to. Ajoy's personal attention,including accompanying us on the trek and the estate drive only added to the delightful experience !!",5
guruduttrv,Your personal retreat in the lap of nature,"Like most other reviewers, i stumbled upon this place on the internet. Thanks to all the good reviews, i didn't have any doubts before going ahead with the booking. Booking process was smooth with Ajoy providing me with all the details. He is indeed very detail oriented and l like it that way. Google maps helped us reach the place without much difficulty. The drive from the main road to our accommodation started to give us a hint of whats in store for us. Ajoy was there to receive us and all i remember from then on is being spoilt by hospitality in the midst of nature. Starting from welcome drinks to three tasty and healthy meals a day, i must have added quite a few calories during my stay. But fret not, his huuuugeee estate has multiple options for nature walks and trekking for",5
Raghu,Family vacation and rejuvenation.,Excellent place to stay. The location of the cottage is amazing and is surrounded by forest. Perfect place to rejenuvate. The chirping sounds of birds through out the day is really soothing. The food is good and coffee is amazing. The early morning hiking and yes estate ride in a jeep is a must do.  Totally a wonderful experience.,5
Bhargav N,Tranquility,Well.... we hit upon this place when we were checking online. This place is run by Mr. Ajoy and it is situated within his Tea Estate. This place has just 4 cottages which can house a maximum of 3 adults each. It is peaceful and the staff are very helpful. Ajoy takes good care of his guests and is very helpful. He also takes you around his estate in the Jeep and gives you a brief overview of the work done at the Coffee Estate. He also took us on a hike to the nearest peak wherein the view was Amazing. There is also a sunset view point bordering his property which is beautiful in the evenings. There are also walking trails inside the estate each carefully classified depending on the severity (Length of the trails are demarcated by markers which are mounted throughout the trails,5
PriyankaMurthy,Peaceful and serene,Kerehaklu resort has 4 beautiful cottages built within a coffee estate. The decor is very pretty and the cottage was neat and clean.

richakulkarni87,Cozy and far from the madding crowd,"I found this place on Tripadvisor and was rather sceptical and had decided to have no expectations, but then I got more than I could have even imagined.   The place is tucked away amidst a huge coffee plantation, which is more like a jungle actually. There are six trails marked across the property which gives you a chance to turn on the explorer spirit in you without getting lost. The place is magical, with so many different flora and fauna. We even spotted an exquisite looking insect, but I don't know the name.  The cottages are cozy, clean and tastefully designed. The food is delicious and not one dish is repeated. And Ajoy the host is probably the highlight of the tip, because you absolutely don't expect meeting such a knowledgeable and fun gentleman. It's super fun to sip a",5
Aanand_Vasu,Best weekend gateway I've ever had,"We went to this place based on TripAdvisor and also based on recommendation from a friend and we were glad we visited Kerehaklu.  This place has everything one expects from a relaxed holiday - serene, clean and feeling like home. It is located inside a 270 acre coffee Estate which the host Mr. Ajoy Thipaiah (trust me, you won't find a better host) took us around in his jeep for an evening tour. The resort has 6-7 trekking trails with markers everywhere so that you can take a tour on your own and be one with nature. Food is absolutely awesome - fresh, almost zero oil, and extremely tasty. There's even a dessert with every meal.  Post dinner, one can wind up next to the bonfire with a glass of beer with Ajoy regaling you with some awesome traveller wild  life experiences.  I can't",5

We started off checking out this place with a lot of hesitation. Couple of reasons being..every comment on tripadvisor mentioned something very nice about the owners..n secondly they asked for a full advance... this gave enough doubt in mind.. skeptical in mind, we landed here around afternoon on a thursday.. from then on it was a surprise till we started back on Sunday.. from then on we started realizing that all the comments on tripadvisor by other visitors were true.. Below is my share of good things for the place: Food: Excellent food. Very simple. Lot of karnataka flavour. The non-vegetarians in the group were very happy with the non-veg dishes. Every meal was very well made. Spl",5

Having contacted Ajoy and having read a few good reviews we set off skeptically on our holiday..Ajoy was very warm and cooperative from the first interaction.The place seemed very quaint and offbeat, not much mobile coverage or wifi , very detailed directions to the place, a signboard at the entrance was probably taken down by some stray animal, The place has some amazing cottages , very clean , aesthetic bathroom, has some very good trekking, walk trails well marked in green, white, blue, orange and red trail arrows indicating difficulty levels in coffee plantation mini forest...

Lakshmi S,A wonderful year-end break at Kerehaklu Eco Retreat!,"Many thanks to reviewers on Tripadvisor for telling us about Kerehaklu Eco Resort. We did not really know what to expect as we had made a last minute booking at this place. But we were pleasantly surprised right from the very beginning when we received a detailed mail about the resort as well as booking formalities from Ajoy along with precise and clear directions to the place. That set the tone for the rest of our experience at Kerehaklu.   We would like to compliment the hosts, Ajoy and Aarti, for their attention to detail in every aspect. The cottages are very well-appointed with thoughtful and aesthetic touches to the decor and amenities. A special mention for the very spacious, clean and well-maintained attached bathroom!

Bhavyaagpt,Very Close to Nature,"We visited the Kerehaklu Eco retreat from 2nd to 4th January. We had planned it to be a leisure trip where we just just sleep or relax however it turned out to be a very exciting and adventurous trip. The entire property of Kerehaklu is of Approx. 220 Acres which is huge and within the property Mr. Ajoy has defined 6 Spice trails. Green being the easiest and Red being the longest and quite tough.  We had enough time to walk on almost all the trails. Mr. Ajoy also personally accompanied us to the hill top near to the property which is about 2 km walk uphill and has a 360 degree view and is a beauty early in the morning. The Evenings were very pleasant with the bon-fire and chit chat with MR. Ajoy.   With his suggestion, we even trekked from Seethalayanagiri temple to",5
Anand B,In the Lap of Nature,"We had a great time at Kerehaklu Eco Retreat. The place is a manna for nature lovers. Ajoy and Aarti are wonderful hosts and their staff is always helpful. The food is great and we really enjoyed trekking and birding through the coffee estate in the various trails. Wished we had stayed for a couple of days more!  This place is best suited for folks who want to unwind in the lap of nature for a few days. If you want to visit places of interest around Chikamagalur, this might not be the place for you as this is almost 30 kms from Chikamagalur town. No TV and limited mobile and internet connectivity makes for a 'secluded from the world' kind of experience. Long scheduled power cuts as well but they do have a generator and the weather was very good so we didn't mind it at all.",5
Pradeep S,A Home away from Home,"After a lot of search on trip advisor, came across Kerehaklu eco retreat as one of the top rated home stays. Booking was easy, send a mail and reply would be immediate. Mr Ajoy was very professional providing all the details prior booking. The homestay is owned by Mr Ajoy & his wife. Very humble and friendly host. Once booking is done, a day before the travel, Mr Ajoy provided detailed route plan on how to reach Kerhaklu. Very useful doc, as I was travelling on my bike from Bangalore the route plan was very helpful. Google maps also provides the route map to this place. Started at 7 in the morning and reached Kerehaklu at around 7. Mr Ajoy was personally there to welcome us. Lunch was waiting and oh my god, the food was awesome.

Once you reach, you don't have to go anywhere else.  The estate itself is very vast (220 acres), you can go for a walk around the estate, take the jeep ride with Mr.Ajoy who makes the ride much more interesting by telling stories about the estate and wildlife around it, tasty food.. everything is right in the estate itself. You don't have to go out anywhere at all !!  The only 2 CONS which we can think (and easily outnumbered by the PROS): 1. A little pain to reach the place as the roads are not in good condition (almost 2-3 kms kachha road)  2.

Chirag S,Honest to Nature,"This is one of the most ""Honest to Nature"" Getaways we have been for some time. We (a family of four) made a 600+ kilometers journey to reach this place from Chennai. So obviously we would have sub-consciously built some expectations - which i am convincingly saying that Kerehaklu exceeded.   Why should you go ?  1. The Hosts:  Ajoy and Arti are excellant hosts. They will make you feel as if you are visiting friends. Very kind and genuine people.  2. Amazing Location: The place itself is really amazing, set on a mountain, away from the madness of city life. Ajoy and Arti own the 300 odd acre estate where they grow coffee. So you get to stay on a plantation. There are lovely treks through their plantation, which is like a mini forest.  3. Great Food - The food is really mouth",5
aquaraga,Far from the madding crowd,"This is an amazing discovery, a perfect weekend getaway from Bangalore. Ajoy's coffee estate is tucked away in a hillock, far from the madding crowd of Chikamagalur. The cottages' (made of wood, and of course sourced from the estate) decor is ideal and prepares you for a surreal experience for your stay at Kerehaklu. Aarti mentioned that it was Ajoy's idea to tear down the tents and redo them in wood. The jeep ride and a few coffee trails (color coded by difficulty) should be on the must-do list for anyone visiting Kerehaklu. The trails give us sneak peeks into the flora and fauna within the estate.  Besides Ajoy and Aarti's warm hospitality; we were also in for some culinary Malnad treats from Raju and Bhagya, who were ever-smiling and attentive to our gastronomic needs.",5
Aknovalli,A good place to relax and enjoy nature,"We visited Kerehaklu for a long weekend in August. The owner of the plantation and our host Ajoy made us feel very welcome. He inquired consistently if we needed anything, made sure we got to Kerehaklu fine, was in touch for several times before our trip. At Kerehaklu, Ajoy took us on a jeep ride + a hike to another plantation over the two days we were there. We enjoyed that quite a bit since neither of us has ever been to a plantation before. The surrounding is very green, lush and quiet. Rooms are rustic, only bare minimum (e.g. no windows, only mosquito nets) but very clean. We also enjoyed the food, it tasted fresh and there was enough variety to enjoy.",5
vivekiyer68,Fantastic homestay,"We had a most wonderful time at the resort. Mr and Mrs. Ajoy Thippiah's hospitality was fantastic. The food was amazing (very authentic local cuisine) and it was a great way to explore the lovely area of Malnad. Ajoy helped us get some lovely coffee and local pepper and cardamom which was awesome. Highly recommended. He also has lovely trails across his plantation where you can hike. He also gave us a lovely jeep tour of the plantation which we thoroughly enjoyed.  The area : Great to visit the Baba Budan Dargah and the Mullaynagari peak (however please try to avoid long weekends)...these attractions become really crowded.  Even though we visited in August, monsoons are not the best time to visit here. I would recommend Nov/Dec as ideal.  Whenever you go, just stay at Kerehoklu.",5
Aditya C,A wonderful relaxing home-stay with great hosts!,"It was by-far the most relaxing and enjoyable weekend getaway I have had from Bangalore!  The place: Kerehaklu has large beautiful cabins made from Red Cedar from their estate, which gives you the true estate-like feel. Each of the 4 cabins has their own bathrooms which are huge, clean and beautifully decorated. With sunsets views of the canyon below and late night bonfires, Kerehaklu's non-commercial isolated feel really gives you a break from the hustle-bustle of daily life. Their expertly marked trekking paths give guidance to the avid trekker who wants to get out into the forest by themselves, leading them right back to the resort.  The weather: was phenomenal. Nestled up in the mountains the temperature is 3-5 degrees cooler than Bangalore (and even Chikmaglur town). We",5

Our trip highlights were  - Mr. Ajoy Thippiah , the owner, he was extremely hospitable, he showed us around his entire estate, took us on treks and was extremely accommodation of all our needs.  The staff are extremely helpful and the food is to die for! If you are looking for 100% authentic chikmaglur food, you will definitely find it here. From Pandi curry, akki roti and wild mushrooms gravy. They really spoil you.  The rooms and spacious and comfortable too. Tucked away from the buzz of Chikmaglur city, the weather is awesome and it's the perfect weekend getaway.  I would definitely recommend checking this place out!",5

Mr Ajoy cusomised the days entirely for us including a wonderful personalized tour of the plantation. He had also provided details of trails that one could explore alone which is great idea for adventurous couples. Last but not least the food was delicious. This is the sort of getaway that one needs every few days to feel absolutely re-rejuvenated!,5
Smita V,A perfect retreat,"We were told of Kerehaklu by a friend and we were glad we took his advice. The resort set amidst a large coffee plantation is simple and yet very comfortable. The log cabin with a small sit out is straight out of Goldilocks and the 3 bears and inside its comfortable with a large bed, wardrobe and a very clean and spacious bathroom. The food is prepared by a cook and you troop off to the dining room for delicious meals with a variety of food made to your liking.There are evening snacks also if you feel like some snacks with your coffee.   The evenings saw us enjoying a bonfire and wine with conversation with Ajoy, our affable host and a 4th generation coffee plantation owner. The days were spent taking long walks around the plantation where Ajoy has helpfully laid out trails with",5
Raghu S,A perfect weekend getaway from bangalore,"We had 2 wonderful weekend trips to Kerehaklu, the first time in 2010 and more recently in 2012. Excellent location within a large coffee estate offering some brilliant walking trails all clearly marked out. Add to it the very nice host Mr. Ajoy and you have a perfect weekend getaway from bangalore that you would want to go back to over and over again. The second time we were there the tents were a little musty but they were in the process of being replaced so the next time we might find new tents.",5
JulieConway831,Lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel. Great value for money. Staff were helpful. Rooms are bright, clean and airy. AC is good. Bed is very comfortable. Bathroom was lovely. Water was hot. Unfortunately the Wi-Fi was not great but it was being fixed. Location is excellent. The restaurant wasn‚Äôt open when we stayed but room service available and plenty of restaurants nearby",6
Amit,Excellent Hotel,Stayed at this property for 3 days and had a great time here. Located right in the center of the city with MG Road hardly a kilometer away. Very courteous and receptive staff including the folks at the reception. The hotel also provides taxi services for sight seeing which I availed of and would recommend others try as well. Will definitely book this property again when I'm back in Chikmagalur.,6
Mohamed M,Best Hotel,"Hotel was neat and clean, staff was Good and helpful overall experience was good at this hotel, recommend everyone, Thanks to Treebo for offering the best stay experience, and the hotel is on best location, easy to access all the things for near by market and bus stand.",6
SumitraSubrahmanya,Good,Overall all stay was good. Please consider eggs and omelet in breakfast. People who don't drink tea or coffee provide some fresh fruit juice. Use some air freshener after room service is done. Comfortable stay!,6
Kotnana Shyam K,It's an awesome experience and stay.,"Was hesitated to check-in based on earlier -ve reviews I had read here, however the host was really amazing. We were in room # 201. It's a pleasant stay, no disturbances, rooms are clean and tidy.   Just go for it.   I will suggest my friends too.",6
aishwarya993,cleanliness much required,"we entered the room , room was pretty much small but seemed to be clean  but after we were back to our room after our function , there were plenty of cockroaches running inside the room and once the light was on it dispersed and we had to clean our bags . i think i saw a minimum of 10 cockroaches and the bathroom was  slightly stinking. i would really suggest that u guys have  to really improve a lot on keeping the room clean . we checked out that night only as we really couldn't stay there!!",6
Harshad2511,Towel are very poor condition,"Improve you service at breakfast area. There is limited item in breakfast. New towel and nepkin require. Location and its room view price looking very high, better options is there at chicmanglor in this rate.",6
ABU492019,Excellent Experience,"Location was excellent. Restaurant at the ground floor has good taste and also value for money. Staff has been very courteous. They provided Iron press to Iron the cloth which is very rare experience. The car was cleaned by the Hotel itself without any charge and demand. Hotel arranged the Taxi. Unfortunately the taxi we required was not available, but they provided Taxi of higher segment in the  same price.",6
Subha14,Not worth chikamagalur,Property is good. But the property is in city and nothing to view from there. Better stay at mullayngiri  or on the way. The local police may not allow to go to mullayngiri for no reason. Especially careful  on sundays. Altogether chikamagalur vist was not worth. Only mullayngiri is worth visiting once but roads are little tricky. Be careful..,6
Vishyvibes,Decent budget hotel but room needs pest control & service quality is poor,"Pros: The location was great and they have a parking facility. Khansama restaurant below was a decent, good one for food.  Cons: The rooms have a lot of small/med sized cockroaches, they did not do pest control. I did not like the attitude of the front office guy who when asked for a specific breakfast item tells you that I either have to choose from Masala Dosa or Vada Idly. I had paid for a complimentary breakfast & he says becuz there are only 2 guest rooms in the hotel that's booked, they can't arrange a buffet breakfast. Well, is that my problem? Anyways, think that it's fine they should reduce the room price and not charge for complimentary breakfast. If you stay for more than one night, no house-keeping comes visiting to clean ur room.",6
Krishnan U,"Overall Ok, Can be better","If your preference is to stay in the Chikamagalur town, Maharaja Inn is a decent Option. I booked througj Treeb. Overall experience is good - Check in was hassle free, rooms are not too small, bed sheets, towels are clean and white and room also gives a clean feeling.  It is on the main road and if you step out, you can find a lot of food options and shops too. Hotel has a small parking and we were able to park our car without any issues.  Breakfast is simple, not too many options and they start that only at 8am. You can always skip that and eat somewhere nearby and you won't miss much.  There is a mosque very very close to the hotel and if you are someone who gets woken up by any noise ( am one of those), you may experience a wake up from the morning prayer around 5am.",6
Rohitv4us,Nice place and location,Very good hospitality and nice location. The checkin options are flexible. Tasty breakfast and friendly staff. They were kind in lettung us know the places to visit.  The rooms were clean and very well maintained,6
DebolinaMukherjee,Can be better,"We stayed at Treebo Maharaja Inn for a night. While the location and the restaurant named Khansama were good, but the rooms need maintenance. Overall the rooms were clean and the bathrooms were neat and clean, however, we found cockroaches in our room. This becomes a bit of a let down as our one year old was travelling with us. The rooms are also very small and feels cramped at times. Coming to their parking, there is a parking space beside the hotel which is again small. So, each time someone wants to take their car out, the others need to go down to move their car. Becomes difficult, as this happened with us over three times. We  were called early to morning to move the car and few other times.",6
@travelfreak,Awesome place with a best in class hotel,Hotel staff & food were very good. Rooms were neat & clean and as same as the photos. It's very near to KSRTC Bus Stand. Hot water is available for 24 by 7. It also has a parking space where u can park your vehicles & it will be safe and secure.,6
Cris Rulzz,best for the travellers,"Chikkamagaluru is the best place to hang out for short travel from bangalore. second time stay in maharaja inn was pleasant. Service was good and the room was neat and tidy. walk-able distance to Bus stand and other amenities like food, hospital and stores.   Best thing was that they obliged for our request.",6
S R,very expensive for facilities provided ... for 5000 per night very expensive.,"cons  - we paid around 5000 for a day for a PREMIUM room very mediocre. - no concierge. reception desk or guard at ground floor. 3 STAR indeed !!!!! - DEMANDED FULL PAYMENT AS SOON AS WE CHECKED IN IN SPITE OF      ADVANCE BOOKING !!!! WE HAD NOT EVEN SEEN THE ROOM.  - very small and uninspiring property ON the main road. Room window faces main road and lights outside reflect inside the room even with the blinds. Disturbs sleep even at 11 pm. - bathrooms average but clean. only shower curtains. bathrooms floors not cleaned     everyday. we stayed for 3 full days. - ac does not work properly. even at 20 degrees.  - break fast quality very ordinary , variety less compared to other similar hotels. - no veg food only non-veg options in house. - no proper ventilation in bathrooms and",6
NidhiPatnaik,Pleasant and comfortable stay..helpful host,"The room and the location are no doubt very good. For me, I was a bit apprehensive as we were 2 women travelling on our own. But, the owner and the staff were very welcoming and made us feel safe which was very important for us.",6
Shubhra2013,More than you can ask for!,"After spending a day and a night in the hills we came down to the city as we had one whole day before we move out.  We went to the hotel and were upgraded to the premium suit. The room was super clean with a thin fragrance of love. The staff was very friendly. The food was devine, perfect blend of flavours and spices. Everything was beyond great. It was truly a DELIGHT FACTOR",6

Saif R,"Great stay, amazing ambience, value for money and friendly staff","As a frequent visitor, I would recommend this place to guests who want a great stay at an affordable price. The rooms have a warm ambience and at the same time contemporary design in elements, starting from the furniture, lighting, wardrobes. bathroom fittings, shower cubicle to common areas like the entrance lobby, lift, staircases and the concierge. Not to forget basic amenities like an in house multi-cuisine restaurant, laundry service and a common pantry are provided on the property. Being inside the property, it has the ambience of a business class hotel while keeping it pocket friendly, clean and at the same time excellent for families.",6
Kamal C,S,Good location with good services with good quality of food. Will definitely recommend to the friends and family...one of the best experiences I have ever had...if you are planning to chickmaguluru then maharaja inn is the place...,6
Shobhit A,"Compact , Neat and Clean Hotel",Hotel is located in the main city.Hotel rooms are compact and small however they are well maintained and neat and tidy.Complementary breakfast serve only on Sunday is good .They do arrange Tour package but we have to pay for it.Overall good experience.,6
Faisal M,Best in class hotel in Chickmagalur,"The hotel is located centrally and close to all basic amenities like pharmacies, banks, restaurants, etc. The ambiance is best in class backed by a team dedicated to providing great service. Highly recommend staying at the Maharaja INN if you plan to visit Chickmagalur.",6
AKK,Decent hotel for the price it charges,The hotel is centrally located in Chikmangalur with most of the restaurants at walking distance...the rooms are also good and well maintained...The service staff is also pretty responsive...All in all a good hotel to stay for people who are value conscious,6
siddhi261,Quite good,It's quite a decent hotel ..  we didn't order food so can't comment . But the service of the hotel is good.. rooms are clean .  It's a good for budget stays .. the are is nice.. walking to my road. And a lot of restaurant on the street,6
srnrd,Value for money,"Location is good. It has good accessability. Rooms are clean, nicely maintained. Morning breakfast is available. Lunch and dinner not available in the hotel. The major drawback is, the hotel does not have their own parking place",6
Venkatt081,Very Good Stay for Families...,"The location of the hotel is its biggest plus. It is right in the middle of the town, very near to quality restaurants(Vishnu delicacy nearby is an excellent choice). The rooms and bathroom were very clean, though the size of the room(Superior AC room I stayed in) was pretty small. The prices are slightly expensive for the town, although it could have been because of the long weekend which meant that every possible hotel room was full in Chikmaglur. To sum it up, a very safe and clean stay for families and business people alike.",6
Madhu B,Good accomodation,"Staff was very helpful, they could guide us to the nearest tourist spots. Comparatively rooms are smaller but very well maintained. We heard some kind of generator noise in the night 1-2 times which was very loud. Apart from that everything else was fine.",6
Jayashree V,My stay in MAharaja Inn,Nice place to stay. Very calm and peaceful. Breakfast is also nice. Housekeeping service is good. It is very near by to bus stand. Rooms are also nice and very clean. Restrooms are clean. Families can stay for peace.,6
Manish P,Nice and comfort stay at Maharaja INN.,"Maharaja INN is situated exactly in-front of Chikmaglur bus stand. So location wise ,it is easily accessible and as its on main road, one can get easily private cab/auto/bus to roam around. Rooms are not much spacious , but its value for money. They have clean bathroom equipped with modern facilities including 24hr hot water. Only Problem we faced was lack of parking space. They don't have parking space, We need to leave our car on main street itself. That was in convenient . Moreover, They don't have common room for driver. Generally every hotel some common room kind of space , where driver can sleep during night.  Breakfast was not much great. Opposite to hotel, there was slum area which can disturb your early morning sleep :P",6
Vijay Kiran A,Nice rooms and ambiance. Breakfast and payment option dissapointing,"The hotel is centrally located and has nice rooms with good ambiance. The staff were very cooperative .However, we didn't like a few things about this place.  1) Complimentary buffet breakfast is served only between 8:30 am and 9:30 am. One of the days' during my stay the complimentary buffet was cancelled without prior information. That impacted our plans negatively.  2) Credit card payment is not allowed. They accept only cash :( 3) No dedicated car parking",6
neeraji2it,Nice and small hotel,Good for quick travellers. Small rooms but neatly maintained. Good and responsive staff. Parking is an issue as you have to park on the road. Good food joints nearby as it's in main market. Can chill out anytime with good food and beer,6
sushmashetty20,Awesome Stay,"Stayed at Maharaja Inn for 2 days in the last week of June. This was our 1st visit to chikamagalur. Though it was a last minute booking, the location of this hotel made it so much more easier for us. it's right at the centre of the city. The staff also helped us by arranging a cab for visiting nearby places at a very short notice. The restaurant is located opposite to the hotel but we were informed that room service is also available if required. Excellent hotel with really helpful staffs.",6
Rahul R,Ecstasy Stay,Pretty good hotel at economical budget for everyone. Welcoming receptionist and also employees are very helpful and friendly. Was pretty clean and neat and would definitely love to stay there anytime I go to that place.,6
SumitAggarwal27,"Well maintained hotel walking distance from M G ROAD, Chickmangalore","The hotel is very well in reach to the bus stand and railway station. Also, walking distance away from MG Road. Very nice and decent restaurants around. Following are my reviews: 1. Very clean and well maintained hotel 2. Staff is friendly and helpful 3. Rooms are very clean  4. Hotel does not have its own functional restaurant but there are many good eateries ( both Veg and non-veg) around the place. 5. Hotel does not have its own parking but still they assist to get your vehicle parked on the road, the have security to look for your vehicle. Conclusion: Good option for families looking for budget hotel.",6
Shijith R,Value for money. Excellent service,"I have stayed here for two days.   Pros:   The hotel was well maintained, room is clean. Prices (including room service) are affordable. They have their own restaurant in the town and they get the food from there. The staff were responsive, including housekeeping. The MD is very knowledgeable and courteous, and interacts with guests very well.   Cons:   Parking: There is no parking available. I do not see it as an issue because almost all the hotels in Chikamanglur town don't have dedicated parking. The roadside parking is well arranged and they have posted a security guard to take care of things.",6
venkatesh756,Stay at Maharaja Inn,"We stayed for 3 nights, booked it based on the reviews in travel portals, average experience. Location of the hotel is good, heart of the town. However, Rooms were on the smaller size, no sofa to sit in rooms. Breakfast was average, could have given more options, like juice, sandwich etc. 2 days we were served BF in our rooms due to shortage of occupancy. I would say average experience .",6
Barun Singhania,"Great Stay, Amazing People","Not sure if its a new hotel. If so, it looks like one, and if not, kudos to the hotel management. Beautifully placed at the centre of the city, it's a nice and clean and a very well maintained hotel. It was totally worth the money spent.

Aqsa B,"Good stay-Maharaja INN,April 2017.","We planned a short family trip to Chikmagalur and spent two nights in Maharaja Inn (junior suite). It's located in the centre of the city. The staff is friendly, respectful and efficient. The pillows are really really comfortable. Room has the basic facilities- a really good air conditioner, toiletries, tea bags , two televisions, a couch ,etc. There is hot water 24/7 and NOT in limited amount ( you can take a long warm shower without running out of hot water). The breakfast has limited items and the quantity is limited as well (advisable to go early to try the variety before it gets over). It is advisable to book here for a comfortable and affordable stay. :)",6

The bed, illumination, Entertainment, Coffee maker, Bathroom/Restroom, Cleanliness etc. are impressive.

Wish them all the very best.",6

preethamkottary,Decent place for overnight stay,"Had booked room for overnight stay. The property is on one of the major roads in the town. the entire row is full of lodges and restaurants.  Rooms were clean and Neat. No issues with Linen. Bathroom was neat and tidy.  The hotel itself doesn't have a restaurant. This isnt a big deal as there are plently of options nearby.  Please note that the property desnt offer parking facility.  You would need to park on the road side. There are sign boards to guide which side of the street should be used for 4 wheeler/2 wheeler parking for different days of the week.  Muthodi wildlife safari is around 30Kms from here. Takes about 75min to get there.   Overall, pleasant stay. recommended for folks who are not particular about homestay experiences and want a decent/safe place to stay.",6
Lehar M,True To Description,"I checked the company's website and everything about the rooms and amenities was true to the description. It's a boutique hotel, centrally located in Chikamangalur, made better by its very helpful and polite staff. There is no restaurant at the hotel, but you can order-in from nearby restaurants. There is also a wide menu for your perusal in each room. If you want to venture out, well, you will be spoiled for options. From local to high-end restaurant, you have it all within walking distance. There is parking space for cars on the main road right outside the hotel. If you don't find space, just call out to one of the staff and they'll help you with it. Want a driver or a travel package with a car and a driver, they'll arrange either for you. The cost of rooms is pocket friendly.",6
Raghavendra S,Very Nice Stay,"very nice and peaceful stay. The nice staff and house keeping. The only suggestions is hotel needs to keep the transportation for sight seeing, the out side is too costly. It is very near to bus stop and in side the town but there is no traffic noice. i liked very much.",6
satya333,A very good family hotel in Chikmagalur.,The rooms were well kept and maintained. The washrooms are spacious. The linen were very neat and clean. The wifi connection is very fast. The staff is very cordial. One drawback is you got to bear with parking on the road.,6

Kiel P,Comfortable stay in Chikmagalur,"We enjoyed a one night stay on NYE at the Maharaja Inn. Mr Khan and his staff went out of their way to welcome us and ensure our comfort. The compact (somewhat small) room was immaculately clean with a comfortable bed, hot showers and English language movies channels.   The hotel has a restaurant by the same name 2 min walk away from the property with delicious veg/non-veg options. We ate dinner there twice and left satisfied and stuffed.   The staff were extremely helpful organizing outings in the area, planning tourist stops and booking late night transportation. Mr Khan even met us for our 1AM departure with some light snacks for our ensuing train journey.   If you are looking for a clean and comfortable modern build facility, look no further than Maharaja Inn.",6

Pasupathy V,The guy at the front desk...,"We stayed here for 1 night with our family. The hotel is located very conveniently with easy access to hotels.   First impressions:  1. Weird layout with narrow entrance and a lobby in the first floor. They don't have parking (most hotels in the area don't have one). So settle for street parking 2. The guy at the reception (who also added that he owns the place) was quiet pleasing & talked well. He was quiet aspirational about the Maharaja Hotel's new venture in the hotel business with this hotel.  3. Check-in was smooth  The issues We were given a room that had issues with the bathroom lock. Initially it didn't lock. I called the front desk and the guys came and did something. Later, it locks you inside and wouldn't open. We struggled with it the next morning, they came again",6
Sanjana B,Good hotel to stay,Good rooms for good price.hot water 24hrs and rooms are very clean.only problem is parking other than that great place to stay.there is a restaurant  across the road which is owned by the same group as the hotel..food is really good.they deliver to the room also so no need to worry about searching for good food.overall a good place with all the basic amenities.,6
subahkataria,Nice cosy comfortable rooms,The stay at maharaja inn for 1 night with family. Had opted for non ac rooms as the weather was on the colder side. The staff was extremely helpful. Hotel is tiny but located on the main road. Also rooms are very comfortable. The breakfast was standard idly vada sheera. The hotel has room service from their restaurant located a km away. Good places to eat around the area also as it is in the heart of the city. The rooms are cosy and great experience for a budget price.,6

reddy8018,"Stay @ Maharaja Inn, Chikkamagalur","Hotel was very clean, courtesy of the staff was also excellent. If parking was available with in hotel premises it would have been still a great experience staying at Maharaja Inn. Break fast was also good, but still it would be great if they serve three to four varieties instead of only one variety. Overall experience was very great. I would recommend this hotel for stay at Chikkamagalur.",6

jain_somil,Nice Hotel! Poor Staff!,"Hotel in newly constructed and well maintained. Location wise it's good. Only problem I had was with the staff which was extremely rude. We arrived a bit early so asked for a early check-in, which we had already conveyed them in advance also. Even though they have rooms available the staff said we need to pay for the whole extra day, which was difficult to agree for 4-5 hours early check-in. So we bargained to a reasonable amount and the staff was okay with it. But at the time of check-out different person was present and he was not honoring the deal and was interested in initiating a fight. Finally things sorted out !! Second thing I didn't like was the room does not have any inside lock facility. Anyone with key can open the room from outside which is not safe at all. Third",6

Jijivthomas,one of the best budget hotel you can find in the city,"This seems to be one of the best budget hotel you can find in the city. The property is good and rooms are spacious with limited amenities though. The staffs were Co-operative and down to earth in nature ( Especially Mr. Khan )!!! Hotel is located in one of the busy road in the city but they don‚Äôt have private parking lot for their guests . However, the staffs were really helpful to arrange the parking spot right in front of the Hotel. Breakfast and dinner provided are of good taste. Thanks Mr. Khan and team for the great service and all guidance you had given for our 2nd day travel (Y)  Hopefully, we will meet again !  --Jiji",6
Rilwan A,Clean and Tidy Rooms,Clean and Tidy Rooms with good interior works. Deluxe non AC room was for Rs.2000 after discounts. But it would have been great if they had provided breakfast.  Manager and the staff were courteous to treat the guests,6
Basant C,Neat and pocket friendly hotel,Homestays are more popular in Chikmagalur; however if you choose to stay in town would definitely recommend this hotel. Nazar was very friendly and co-operative; ensured we had a comfortable stay. Most of the tourist attractions are 35-40 KM from here. Overall we had a nice stay!,6
SudhKS,Pleasant stay at Maharaja Inn,Positives  Value for money;  Located in the heart of the town New property Spacious bathrooms Friendly staff  Suggested Improvements 1) Attention to details -  a) a simple gesture of keeping water bottles could have enhanced our experience.  b) We had to repeatedly request them to change the towels.  2) No restaurant facility - however this is not a major concern as there are hotels nearby.,6
priyank m,Pleasant stay,We had one night stay at Maharaja INN and it was quite comfortable. The behavior of the staff was up to the mark. Location is also an added advantage as there are many good restaurants available nearby. Would surely recommend this place to friend to stay.,6

Rajat Kulshrestha,Professional hospitality,"I didn't expect Chikmagalur hotels to be so spick and span and so professionally manned.The exterior is small,with reception on the first floor and rooms from first to fourth floors.The rooms may appear smaller to some but are well furnished and well lit by ample natural light. Electrical and bathroom fittings are contemporary and add to the ambiance of the rooms.Staff and management are helpful and smiling.Lack of an in house restaurant is made up by plenty of restaurants nearby,less than 100 steps away.",6
Sanjaykar S,More than Satisfying,Awesome rooms with all facilities. Very good place for families and worth the money. You will definitely have a feeling at home. Friendly staffs and very helpful.

shabari e,Looks are deceptive,"Having known Chikmagalur, this hotel was a pleasant surprise. Small rooms, but clean &  tidy. Check in was quick, the receptionist provided every data that I requested for. The room was small, but looked neat n tidy. But the room spray smell was growing on us and I had a running nose. The bed looked to be comfortable initially but proved to be not so good for the back. Mosquitoes added to the woes here. The guys at reception played songs, spoke to each other loud during the night time, though my room was the farthest from the reception!!  At around 5am, a hen in the neighborhood wouldn't stop snoozing!! Overall understood that looks can be really deceptive, in spite of the promise this hotel oozes out. Scope of improvement is tremendous.",6
suryakanta2009,Excellent,"Hotel Maharaja INN is very good hotel in budget price. Rooms and bathroom are modern, very neat & clean room and hot water facility is available. There was a big wall hanging TV with TataSky connection available. WiFi connection is also available but speed is not good and sometime getting disconnected. Car parking is outside hotel (road side) but there is no risk as CCTV is install and security boy also keep an eye on it. Hotel boy, Manager and front desk are very polite and helpful. Travel desk also available in hotel but price is little high. You can book one or 2 days package to visit places Food is not available same hotel but just opposite side of the road (100 miter) they have restaurant [Maharaja Veg & Non-veg]. Also there are many good restaurant around the hotel within",6

Most friendly and helpful staff ever, so lovely and great first impression of hotel. They guided me so well giving the directions to look the city around, shop and for sightseeing along with a helpful map, ensuring parking in car park and facilitating an early check in. Fortunately everything about the hotel was exceptional and I don't give praise lightly. It was clean, stylish, rooms with excellent service. Their restaurant is linked closely, where we had lunch and dinner. Food was beyond good and great value for money and service in both places attentive and efficient.

Mazin2014,The Best non veg restaurant i have been to ever,"The best non veg restaurant i have ever been to. They have a variety of dishes, chicken, mutton, prawns and fish and in almost every style imaginable. The menu itself is around 30 pages. Felt like visiting chikmagalur just for eating here.  Not sure about the accomodation, but the restaurant is simply superb..",6
svag,Worst Hotel and even worse staff,"I am listing the deficiencies in Treebo Sunrise, Chikamaglur.  1) Staff and Manager are very rude. There is absolutely '0' % concept of Hospitality or Customer Service. I am pretty sure they have no clue what that is.   2) Rooms are dirty and the accessories such as Towels etc. are in a bad shape.  3) Amenities such as TV, AC, Shower etc. Are not working.  4) Breakfast is served as if they are giving it to beggars. Coffee and Tea is served only half a cup and we are told that ' Free you get this much only '. As I understand breakfast is paid for and written as ""Included"" and it is not complimentary.   Also the breakfast doesn't have bread Butter or Cereals or anything else . Only Idli, Dosa and chutney and that also in limited quantity. I wonder in which hotel is this known as",7

ChethanKeshavamurthy,Over all experience,Over all experience was good. Staff was humble and provide best services. Kodus to Tejas support staff how was very supportive. Little tricky to find hotel using Google map. Required big board / sign board at corner of the road. One negative is bathtub don't have stopper (no use of bathtub),7
Harsha M,Good and comfortable stay,First thanks for Ram from Treebo for smooth and comfortable experience and getting me the best price which is worth every penny for the room. Really appreciate the hotel people for being in touch for room cleaning periodically and reminding for complimentary breakfast,7
Abhinaya,Pleasant stay,"We had a wonderful time staying here. The AC was not working, so they upgraded us to a family suite. All rooms were very spacious, cleanly kept. Staff were courteous.They asked us to have breakfast at the next door restaurant. Would definitely opt for staying at Treebo properties again.",7
Aynarox,"Good Stay, Great Location Costly wrt Amenities Available","Good Stay, Great Location Costly wrt Amenities Available. More varieties should be introduced in the complimentary Breakfast.  Room was good but the look&feel and the amenities didn't seem worthy of 1700/- per night.",7
Travelkeda,It is a fraud with immature employees,"A terrible place and a fraud. The place is located in an obscure lane, which is very difficult to locate and when you call the Treebo office for location they pretend that they are talking from the hotel location but in-fact they are reading from the google maps, all the while located in some city call center.  All the information provided about the hotel by the booking team is completely false and they build castles in the air for you. Not at all trustworthy company this Treebo, they are fooling you!!! The breakfast they serve is just 2-3 dishes (idli, upma and vada), which are all terribly cold and when mentioned to the staff, they replied that the breakfast is outsourced and hence they cannot do much about it. Also the quantity is very limited, so you need to be an early",7
13it,Good enough for short stay,"Centrally located place with a basement parking. Checkin was qucik.  Rooms were compact with all required facilities. Hot water was available 24x7 with basic toiletires being provided. In room complementary tea-coffee counter was a decent addition. Despite a large glass window, it's better to keep it covered as it offers absolute zero view. Linens were clean and sleep quality was good. AC was working fine. Overall floor and room cleanliness were good. Staff was helpful.  They have a tie-up with a local restaurant but the same restaurant serves faster when ordered via online food delivery apps. Such deliveries are delivered directly to the room.  Included breakfast had very limited options but were freshly prepared and Ok in taste.  Two things could have been better -  1. Masks",7
sindhuhegde,Amazing Experience,"We stayed at Sunrise for 2 days, the experience was really great. The rooms were very clean, and well maintained; the staff were also polite and good. It is at the prime location inside the city, about 1km from bus stand. The only missing thing at Sunrise is a restaurant - we need to look for good restaurants nearby which makes it a little annoying. Rest all things about Sunrise was lovely.",7
Chetansr,Decent stay with improvements towards complementary breakfast,Room was small when matched with the price. It was neat and bathroom was clean. Only issue is complimentary breakfast which was not managed properly. Reachability to hotel is little confusing as we need to move into small road. They have underground parking for limited vehicles. I parked almost outside during my stay. Near to main road which is advantage to reach other places.,7
soorya_bhanu,Breakfast was good in taste,my feedback to the staff would be to add more variety to the food and could have been better in taste and add some instant heating burners for the food items being kept at the time of serving that would have ensured that the food was hot as i experienced that the food was bit cold when served. i would definitely recommend this hotel for visit if all these things are taken care of going further.  Other wise overall it was very good in terms of staff behavior and Thank you Treebo for giving me a Pleasant experience :). you Guys Rocked,7
Bade786,Chikmagalur Stay - 02 days,Hotel is located in a prime area of chikmagalur. Its very near to Bus station. Stay is good. Rooms are well maintained. Cleanliness is also good. Only setback according to me is that there is no restaurant. One need to either go out or put an order which seems to be problematic for people travelling with kids and older parents. Breakfast is good though. I also feel that the hotel is a bit overpriced for the facilities they provide. Under INR 1500 per day for a standard room should be a good deal,7
Dinesh,Horrific experience,"I had booked room for my family in Treebo Tree Sunrise.  1. I made 50% payment, though it was not mandatory 2. I called front desk 2 days before and confirmed booking 3. A day before, I did web checkin  But when we reached the hotel, the front desk person said that booking is cancelled!! My room was given to somebody else and absolutely no communication to me.  Then I called booking.com, who confirmed that my booking is valid. I checked from front desk system, the room was booked against my name! (I took photo as well)   What shocked me was the casual arrogant attitude of the staff - who just didn't care. I was suggested go find some other hotel.  Then I called the hotel corporate helpline and they promised to resolve, but nothing happened for 2 hours. The staff didn't even",7

One incident I wish to share during my visit here, I asked for laundry but staff asked that may I do iron this make me feel impressive and he given iron stand with iron box.   It's situated in Center of the city so we will get multiple options for shopping, chats, snacks, restaurants by walkable distance.   I definitely book this hotel only in my next visit also  Regards,  Lohit D",7
Meet_Amrutia,"Clean, spacious and very supportive staff!",The cleanliness of the rooms were to the mark and quite spacious.  The staff were supportive and were helpful.  Suggestion: Tied up restaurant Partner Grand Maharaja is not at all worth. Neither the food nor the attitude of the restaurant staff is tolerable.,7
mkarthick271,"Good rooms, bad parking","The rooms were great, neat and clean. Good place to stay. Bathrooms were maintained well.    Cons: The guy sitting at the front desk has an unwelcome attitude. The hotel is located in a narrow road. The underground parking has a steep down ramp and the parking space is small. If you leave early for sightseeing then you need to navigate your car among the parked cars and the steep up ramp. Not recommend for guests having big cars .",7
PANKAJ M,Pathetic hotel to stay,"Dirty room , dirty blankets, dirty pillows, dirty bathroom, no food availability. They buy breakfast from other restaurant and then serve you over the breakfast.  Not worth to spend that much. Pathetic service. No proper AC . The pics available on the websites should be from the inauguration. No hot water available in the bathroom. If they have more guest they have all the excuses for not providing you timely service.",7

After sometime, my father went upstairs and called the staff from second floor. Everyday, whenever we want to get a room key, we kept on looking for reception staff and called them from second or third floor. Few reception staff doesn't know any language other than Kannada. Reception staff doesn't have proper information about their hotel. Toilet/Bathroom never cleaned in 4 days of our stay.",7
abhiram95,Best and valuable stay in city center.,"Hotel and room was very clean except for small things with facilities and parking. Spacious parking can accommodate 12 cars. Good room service and updated facilities. Spacious bathroom in premium room with one king and one queen bed that can accommodate 5 people easily. 24 hour hot water, bath tub and big cupboard and great aesthetic lighting. Friendly staff but less at night which puts pressure on them to run around for everything. Restaurant is closed due to covid. You need to make arrangements before 10pm as everything is shut by 10:30pm max. The facilities for the price paid is worth. Hope they maintain the same going forward.",7
Amit Kumar,comfortable stay,"Much better hotel than expected. Clean linen, provided extra mattress for kid, bathroom was clean, spacious room. Breakfast can be improved.  Only thing is I had to request for extra mattress and that too was quite small for two kids.  My suggestion is to make extra mattress default for every extra kid and charge extra while booking itself.  Rest everything was good",7
ashwini p,Bad experience,The stay was very bad experience. The rooms were very small and no lighting. The room had only ac and no fan. Also we traveled with 6 year old and it had no restuarant. so even if you need coffee or anything you have to swiggy.. The lady in the reception says contact treebo customer service for any queries. Not sure why she was sitting there. total bad exp. we had to cancel our two nights to one night and vacate imm.,7
Varun LV,"No room service, very bad location","I had been with the family, initially family refused to enter the building as the area was very bad. It does not give you the feeling of you are in ""Chikkamagalur"". ""THERE IS NO ROOM SERVICE"". I kept on calling for room service no one picked, when asked i got a response, ""Oh sorry sir, we forgot to inform you that we do not have room service"". I reduced my stay to 1 day and took another hotel for rest of the days.. Had a very bad overall experice. Mostly probably i'll never use Treebo again....",7
Yeshas b,Good stay,"Nice hotel to stay. Very well maintained n clean rooms. Suggested for family trips. Though parking space is limited, the comfort of staying here will nullify that. Happy with the complimentary breakfast.",7

The hotel location is good and they have basement parking also.The suit room where we stayed was quite big with two double beds. The room was clean. The bathrooms were in need of maintenance. As with other Treebo hotels mattresses and pillows were not comfortable and needs replacement. The breakfast was worst I have seen in any hotel. The menu was limited, quantity was limited and the quality was worst. Breakfast menu was Idli and some rice verity on both days. There are some good restaurants around but early morning you can not go out for breakfast. Overall just ok.",7
Nads0923,Average hotel,pros: Good location. Good reception and lobby area. Room had sufficient provision for Tea and Coffee. A/C & TV were good.

Spl mention to signal cafe and Vishnu delicacy; these are the only 2 hotels nearby I found visiting with good food.",7
Aj P,Good Budget Hotel in the town,"Looks like a new hotel . Decent size rooms , clean bathrooms , clean linen . They do not have a restaurant but only serve morning complimentary breakfast.

Rest all was very satisfying.",7
Andy663,Treebo - Please avoid,"Have been to many properties across cities, but never stayed in one which sucks in every aspect. First attempt with Treebo and would never try it again. Here are some aspects to consider. 1. The front desk person appears like havent taken a bath himself for several days and isnt interested in entertaining guests etc. Only thing clean on him is a white Treebo shirt. 2. In the room, we ran into linen which was not cleaned after the previous guest checked out. The hotel's response is that we are short of staff and washing machines these days dont clean properly. But then they were unable to explain the wrinkles and hair on it. 3. Bathroom wasnt cleaned after previous person checked out. Since bathroom's did not have a bin, the earlier guest had littered paper towels after cleaning",7

Anil Kumar,Average Hotel!,Do not go with great expectation. Normal hotel in the mid of the town. Can be maintained in a better manner. Wash room was stinking. Staff was responsive. Breakfast was a total disaster. if it rated two star hotel then it is ok. But do not expect a three star comfort. if the hotel operate like this will loose business for sure!,7
Sona M,Excellent value for money,Treebo Trend Sunrise was a perfect choice for my short stay down south .I was pleasantly surprised to note how clean and spacious the room was .I would definitely opt to stay at a treebo hotel based on this experience and hope that all are maintained to the same standards.,7

No operational restaurant in the hotel.  For every request/issue, we had to walk down to the reception.

I won't recommend this hotel to people, who like me, want to have a leisure time in their hotel room.Having no kitchen facility is the biggest drawback. We reached around 8pm and then we had to look for a place to dine out. The staff at reception didn't try to lend a helping hand. Even the morning breakfast was not hot. It looked like they kept the breakfast since 7 in the morning. The lift wasn't working.

Flyer30360942133,treebo sunrise experience,"the rooms were good, clean, with good, fresh linen.  bathrooms were good and clean. AC worked fine.The only area which left much to be desired was the breakfast. It was cold, not very well cooked and the Tea was over boiled with lots of sugar not suiting those who want tea/coffee with low or no sugar at all. The breakfast thus needs a lot of improvement so as to be ale to match the rest of the experience which otherwise was good.",7

Ramya H,V.Good stay but good is not enough,"Hotel had a spacious room, very neat and clean. It also had L shaped sofa set with teapot. Bath room had bath tub and Spacious again. Located in central place of Chikmagalur...The only issue was customer service.. we were 3 adults and 2 children staying in the room and they provided extra bed at addl cost. However, amenities provided was for two... every time we need to ask them to provided extra towel, soap and had to remind couple of times. There were instances they said they don‚Äôt have extra towels. If they could improve customer service, this hotel is dam good to stay for couple or family.. it has nice lobby and  covered car parking.",7

Priyanka Pratishruti,Good option of stay,"The property looked new and nice in the images at the time of booking and it actually is quite well maintained. Staff are courteous. Property location is good and nearby market area is easily accessible. The downside is difficulty in parking (if you coming with your own vehicle). Parking facilities are in the basement and it gets really difficult to park or take out your vehicle if the parking is full (which is most of the times). There is no staff from hotel to assist during parking. Restaurant at hotel serves only vegetarian food. However, there are near-by restaurants that will deliver non-veg food to the rooms upon ordering. Buffet breakfast menu is quite small but food is decent. Overall it was a plesant experience staying at Treebo Sunrise, Chikmagalur",7

pranjal2911,Awesome experience,"After searching through variety of hotels, we found Treebo Sunrise in Chikmagalur.The location is perfect, connected to the main MG road which has all types of food and other basic necessities are available. They have cab facilities for Mullayanagiri, Baba Budan giri etc and other near by tourist areas.We stayed for one night only but didn't faced any issue. Rooms were clean and well maintained, all amenities promised were available. Parking space is good. Service is quick and satisfactory. We asked for an extra mattress which was already arranged before we entered the room unlike other hotels where you may have to make certain calls.I would recommend this hotel for trips with family/friends. For solo traveler, this place is a little expensive.",7
Ram Charan Tej,First Experience with Treebo,"I had doubts before I booked Treebo and you proved me wrong. I booked for 4 days & 3 nights for Delux Room. It was good stay overall, staff were kind & courteous, room was clean & tidy, daily room service was fabulous. I stayed in Delux room which is spacious enough comes with Sofa, coffee table, queen sized bed, spacious bathroom with tub bath, TV & excellent interiors with lightnings. One of the reasons I had booked Treebo Sunrise instead an another Treebo hotel in chikmagalur was restaurant. But unfortunately I got to know that this restaurant was closed here and that made us to search for hotels near by. Since Treebo Sunrise Hotel is in center of the town, we had options of restaurants nearby but being a vegetarian it was hard to find restaurants in Chikkamagalur but I found",7

Arpita,Needs improvement,Pros: 1.Helpful manager. 2. Spacious room. 3. Clean linen. 4. Food quality good. 5. Food price reasonable. 6. Location is near to market and petrol bunker.  Cons: 1. Access road to hotel is narrow for xuv or Innova/ertiga. 2. Basement parking difficult if any banquet is underway or hotel has full occupancy. There's barely space in front of the hotel and that too is taken up by auto-rickshaws. No valet services but the manager helps to give parking directions. 3. Breakfast items finish up within one hour and no effort to provide more if anyone turns up a little later than one hour even though the buffet is officially open from 7:30 till 10am 4. Bathroom did not have any clothes hanging facilities so you need to hang stuff on the slippery door knob. 5. You need to ask for,7

Kingkunj,"Good location,Average service","We stayed in the hotel for 1 day on 16-06-2018.The hotel is located right inside the town , near the ksrtc bus stand , which makes it easily accesible. The rooms were clean and well maintained. That's all the good things . But these plus points are easily undone by the poor maintenance of the place. We had two rooms booked in the 1st floor and the bathrooms in both the rooms had a foul smell and even the water smelled awful making it nearly impossible to take a bath.  The breakfast buffet , not even sure if it could be called that , was pathetic and poorly managed. All the items were short in supply. There was a long waiting time for the food stuff to arrive. The staff at the restaurant were not really keen to do their best job. Not really recommended for a pleasant stay.",7
Arpit Dharia,"Neat Rooms, Awesome Ambience, Great service, courteous staff, good location, comfortable stay, value for money","This was my 1st stay with a Treebo hotel and I was more than satisfied with overall experience.

Treebo is a true brand and I shall recommend Treebo to all other travellers and also book Treebo hotels for many of my future stays .",7
Umesh Gupta,Ended our vacation.,"The phone number they have advertised never rung. We tried reaching before and after the booking.  Their Mahogany or Premium room or family room have two double beds which attracted me to do the booking for family.  But the whole experience was terrible.  Big bathrooms, but they have installed Bajaj exhaust fans which make shrieking horrible loud noise which will wake you up,   in room number 206. Voltas AC makes snapping sound every few minutes. There are no hooks in washroom to hang your clothes or hand towels. No soap dish on wash basin. Where do you keep the soap?!? Provided plastic cracked black cups for tea coffee in the room, which ended up spilling tea on us. Do not provide spoon or stirrer stick. How do you make tea or mix milk in tea?!?.  We had booking for 4 nights.",7
Abhishek J,"Good rooms, poor service","The rooms in this hotel are very nice, new modern rooms with most facilities. Especially 4 bedded mahogany rooms - very good, has two bathrooms. But service is challenging, it is being managed in most haphazard way - tea not available most of the time as milk not there, no aalu paratha as potatos are finished, tea coffee is cold in breakfast and whenever they served. Parking is for 5-6 cars and becomes challenge to get in or out if more cars are parked, crammed space. In summary, rooms are new and nice, service is ad-hoc. They need some strong manager to put things in order.",7
Kaushik R,Chikmagalur travel ideas,"I traveled to Chikmagalur between 5th to 7th of May 2018 and stayed at Treebo Sunrise.  The hotel is located in the heart of the city so for those traveling by public transport it is easily accessible, but the downside is that it is almost 20+ Km away from all the tourist spots and as a result traveling prices may seem to be exorbitant.  If you are traveling in your own vehicle, i would suggest you to get a local driver, this saves you the fatigue and time that you might spend searching for the next destination.  Better to do your homework before you go there so that you have a list of places you want to visit.  The place is good for a 2-3 day stay.  Please note that there are N-number of home stay options and these home stays are located in amazing locations on the hills as",7

First day when I reached I had lunch with me so I told them to bring me two plates. Still waiting for the plates. Second about water bottles. They provide two half litre of water bottle for one day. Can you please explain for one day one person will drink only half litre of water. If u want more you have to pay n take. Wow what a fine selling logic you have. Atleast you should provide 1 litres of two bottles. Seriously i was amazed with this concept. You are charging 2300 per person and providing only 500 ml bottle of water to drink. Donot be so money making. If you are giving any service provide it in a good way. Third the office staffs are unaware of the sites also. They do not have the,7

Instead i was provided 2 table fan for the big room in hot summer. not many options were available in food. I have been told its only 3 months since the hotel have been opened. wonder how the AC will not work within 3 month.  Pro's: 1. In the city. 2. Service is good. 3. Food tastes good(Only veg) 4. Big and spacious rooms.  Con's: 1. Some other system like AC wont work, and leaking parking lot. 2. Not many options in food. 3.

Still the same. So we had ended with Rice and Dal. The efficiency of service was very poor. No attention towards customers. When we have complaint about the food to manager, we got a very poor reply from manager. He was saying it was fresh and good and no one has complained.

The hotel staff is very very and again very helpful and courteous, they will do every and anything they can to ensure your stay is good. The staff is always very quick to respond.

One extraordinary thing about this resort is the food they serve. It was THE delicious food i have ever had in an hill resort. Mr.Vijay took good care of us and was always keen to help and provide us extra comfort. The campfire, the DJ, the Fireworks everything was a treat for us. One disadvantage might be the network issue that we faced. ONLY BSNL will be working there. So this is one good resort to enjoy the weekend with a silence yet scintillating ambiance.

Divaker G,Not so Great,"The Resort is at a great location,  but not so great service. We stayed there for New year's eve and regretted. The rooms were too overpriced and in case you chose to stay in tents,  the resort does not have enough washrooms. Washrooms were not even clean enough.  The tents are not small for two people,  but in case there is no cloud cover,  tents tend to get too hot in the noon.  We never felt any support from the staff,  except the restaurant manager,  who was very friendly. Food seemed repetitive for Two days lunch and dinner.  overall, great location,  but  not so good service and a bit overpriced. They even charge separately for water.",8

The doors of my room were making rattling sound because of the sound. Very cheap wood doors are there and they ram in the walls making huge bang across the hotel. 2.

When we complained to the manager, we were promised (several times) that the power will be back in 10 minutes. It was very frustrating. The geyser was not working and the food was bad at best. I wouldn't recommend this place to fellow travelers.",8

Sumit,"Not professional greedy, try to make money even when chikmanglur flooded","We booked it through MMT, total 3 rooms for 2 days. Due to the current situation as it's flooded everywhere our travel agency cancelled the cab service Citi g it's not safe to travel chikmanglur and all the routes are closed. Hotel MGMT is not ready to accept it and gave only one day refund, they try to make money even in natural calamity. We won't recommend them. If we had cancelled due to personal reasons then it's valid  not to refund.",9

A Ganesh Kumar,Things go Missing in this Hotel,"We stayed for 3 nights on a family trip in last week of May'19. Our experience was so bad. THINGS went MISSING in the room after we return in the evening. Upon alarming with front office and hotel manager, they just didn't care for and rather argumentative. Cramped or no parking space. Small and cramped rooms. No one cares to do service in the restaurant. This is highly UNRELIABLE hotel and will never recommend to anyone.",9
Ashok6768,Comfortable stay,Stay was comfortable. Room is very neat and clean. But rooms are not spacious and no space after keeping bed. Washrooms are very clean and tidy. Good for short stays. May not be sufficient for big family otherwise good choice.,9
Sirish9,"Centrally located, very decent rooms and staff but unexpected room","The hotel was reasonably priced considering it was the holiday season. The staff was courteous. The restaurant  was decent as well. This is at the city centre but accessible to the attractions via vehicle. However- though we had booked two family rooms (4 people per room), only one such room was provided (two big beds joined to accommodate 3-4 people), and the other - facing it- is a room with two beds separated by a pillar(column). And each bed could accommodate only 1 or 1.5 persons and they cannot be joined together due to the column. When asked, we were told an extra bed will be provided between the beds but it was obviously impractical. I persisted saying that we had even made sure by enquiring before our travel that 2 exact rooms are needed. I was told the kind of big",9
dsubha,Really small rooms,"The room size was really small with about a couple of feet space aside of the queen size bed. However the room was clean and well-maintained at the check-in. However, no room cleaning was done on the following day (we were there for 2 nights)  It was also disconcerting that a much better room was allocated to an associate of mine even though both of us booked at the same class (Deluxe AC)",9
GdTraveller,Decent hotel near bus stand,This hotel is in decent loaction in middle of city. But to see the attractions you will have to hire a taxi to visit around the places. Price is reasonable. You can get good offers at various websites. Buffet breakfast provided was good. Rooms are bit small but comfortable.,9
Vinay K,Excellent Service and Good Staff,"Room was very neat and good looking ,Good Services and staff was very kind.Overall it was an excellent Stay at hotel.Only thing was Food was average and it was over-priced.    Food did not meet expectations,as it was average in taste.",9
Sat_samp,Good hotel - but layout could have been better,"The hotel is located within a reasonable distance of the two roads that form the town centre. They have limited parking slots in their basement, so I had to park my car outside although the security staff ensured it was safe (he pointed to the CC TV cameras around!!).  The rooms were small, and only had queen beds. This made it difficult for us - as a couple with a small child. We had to ask for an extra bed to make it more comfortable (this is something not explicitly mentioned in travel booking websites!!). The hotel layout had lots of space between rooms, also the bathrooms were fairly large. So, I do think the layout of the rooms could have been better - bigger and allowing to fit in king size beds. The amenities in the room were good though - AC, ceiling fan, TV, Kettle",9
prithvi2018,One of the best hotels in Chikmagalur,We did visit a few hotels and found this to be the best hotel to stay albeit expensive.Has various room types for a family. Has a good morning breakfast inclusive. Good service. Definitely recommend it.,9
Sheshagiri R,Wonderful Stay at Crystal Inn,We had a nice stay at Hotel. Very clean Hotel and Honest staff especially to be named Teja and Preethi in front office. While check our we forgot our ornaments bag at reception and realised only after reaching Bangalore.  But Mr.Teja found our missing bag and returned to us as it is. Thanks for all help of honest staff.,9
Krishnamohan M,Excellent hotel,We extended family of 10 people visited this hotel in 1st week of August 2018. Excellent restaurant with delicious vegetarian food.staff behavior is very good and they will help you plan your trip with guided maps. Breakfast spread is like any 4star kind. Bathrooms are big in size and very neat & clean.   Room size is not that big if you have too much luggage and they don't have sufficient parking space though they will help you to park your vehicles safely.  Overall loved the stay and best hotel in town in 2-3 star category and definitely going to visit this hotel again. Best place to eat in cosy environment.,9
Ramesh S,Very good place to stay !,"A warm welcome from the staff. I like to thank the entire group of staff to keep and maintain the cleanliness and hygiene of the place to at its best !

Would recommend this place !And we will definitely come back!!",9
Anu M,Wonderful stay at Crystal inn,Had been to Chikmagalur recently and we chose to stay at Hotel crystal inn. We stayed in Deluxe double bed room. The hotel is very much in the main area and easy to locate as well. The hotel staffs were very polite and helpful. The rooms were well maintained and very neat. We had free breakfast in our package. The food was very delicious. On the whole a very good and well maintained hotel. Would like to visit them again. Thank you.,9
Vinodhsom,My experience at Crystal Inn,"Overall it was a good stay at the hotel. Service is good and check-in made simpler. Location is quite good, easily accessible to the restaurants and sight-seeing spots.   However even in a Deluxe A/C room, as shown in the photos, the rooms are quite smaller and hardly any place to move around in the room. And the buffer breakfast has minimal spread, which is something you would love to see few more items.",9
myselfajith,Nice little hotel,This is a nice little hotel in one of the main road of Chikmagalur. The lobby was good. The check in was smooth.. The service was very good. They went out of the way to fulfill our needs. The rooms are clean though a little small for my liking. The wash rooms were big and clean. The restuarant was pure veg which was a disappointment for me. Overall an excellent hotel.,9
RedShan,Average hotel with bad room service.,"I have stayed two days in crystal inn with family and friends. My reviews based on that.  Location: Hotel situated in heart of the city. But no greenery or pleasant view. 4 star for that. Rooms: Very small rooms. Only two adults and a kid can accommodate in AC deluxe room. Third adult is highly impossible. But rooms are neat. 3 stars for that. Food: Good but not great. The breakfast menu is limited. You will have only idly, vada, one rice item, bread, juice and tea/coffee only. After we asked we got dosa. But it's not displayed in the buffet. Also it's pure veg hotel and you need to go out for non veg every time.3 stars. Parking: Underground parking area is little congested and only 6 cars can be parked at a time I believe (more or less). Really don't know how they manage in",9
ShySri,Good hotel in the heart of the town,"This was my first visit to Chikmagaluru and I wanted it to be memorable. I chose this hotel after seeing the positive reviews and the pictures uploaded by other travellers. Let me be very precise Pros: Clean room and bathrooms, Great food in the hotel, Good hospitality, Cordial staff Cons: there aren't really any cons except the fact that the quantity of food was less. Otherwise it's great.  I'd recommend this book for a budget stay with a feel of luxury. Everything just clicked for me.",9
rohitprakashmathur,Nice and clean,Nice and clean property in central Chickmaglur. they have small parking. Full property is neat and clean with shining marbles floor. Nice ozy AC rooms. Nothing fancy but at this price what else we can ask. Good food at room service and nice breakfast at cafeteria. Great experience,9
Hrkn B,Neat hotel comfortable stay,We stayed in the family suite...which was very neat and room well maintained. The beds are not suitable for 4 adults.  Breakfast was simple and decent. Courteous staff and peaceful stay. Interiors well designed,9
Rajbolmal,Value for money,"Pros : Good complimentary breakfast, in terms of quality of food, it's one of the best in chikmangaluru. The taste is awesome. The Italian and contintental food also is fantastic.   Clean rooms and good room service  Polite staff and a very good manager   services like taxi for tour is also available at a cheaper price.   Cons : Considering the room tariff  the room size could have been bigger.",9
kkeshav357,awesome experience,"Hi CrystalInn Team,  It was nice to stay with you, Team, food ...everything was just awesome in serving us. You rock guys. Looking forward to visiting this hotel again. Definitely will recommend this to my friends  üòäüòé",9
